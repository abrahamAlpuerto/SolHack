{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "What is Bitcoin?", "output": "Bitcoin is a decentralized digital asset. It was invented in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto, an anonymous developer, as a response to the traditional financial system bailing out failed banks. The idea was to create a new form of money, or “peer-to-peer electronic cash system,” fully owned by its participants and outside the control of centralized entities, such as governments and banks. To pull this off, Satoshi developed (1) bitcoin, the currency and (2) Bitcoin, the network. Bitcoin, the currency (denominated as BTC) is a decentralized cryptocurrency (or digital asset) with a capped supply of 21 million (of which ~19 million have already been mined). As mentioned above, BTC was invented to be a form of money, but now it acts more as a store of value. Like gold. Due to its scarcity, bitcoin can protect your purchasing power and hedge against inflation. However, unlike gold, bitcoin is hard to confiscate and easy to “transport” and transfer. This is due to Bitcoin, the network. Bitcoin, the network, is a peer-to-peer (P2P) network of computers (and the people behind them) that run the Bitcoin protocol (the set of rules for sending and receiving bitcoin). This network maintains the public, decentralized database (the Bitcoin blockchain) that tracks the creation, ownership, and transfer of bitcoin, the currency. To ensure that the database is accurate, the computers verify that each update follows the rules of the Bitcoin protocol. If it doesn’t, it’s ignored. If all computers agree, it’s accepted. This happens through a process called proof-of-work (PoW). Proof-of-Work (PoW) is Bitcoin’s consensus mechanism. It’s what makes Bitcoin possible. Because it doesn’t have a centralized body, Bitcoin relies on its decentralized network of computers to verify transactions. These computers (or “miners”) compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles to verify new data, and the first to solve them earns newly-created bitcoin (in a process known as “mining”). This mining process secures the network, removes the need for a trusted third party, and enables the creation of new bitcoin. Now, let’s sum things up. Through the combination of its virtual currency, decentralized network, public database, and PoW consensus mechanism, Bitcoin developed a new alternative financial system free of centralized authorities and middlemen."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "What can you do on Bitcoin?", "output": "Although Bitcoin was created to be a new form of money, its various network upgrades (SegWit, native SegWit, taproot) have unlocked newer, exciting use cases: Bitcoin non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Bitcoin Name Service (BNS), and more. But before we dive into these newer use cases, let’s cover Bitcoin’s primary purpose—finance."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Decentralized Finance (DeFi)", "output": "Bitcoin is a decentralized financial (DeFi) system. When you buy BTC (and, thus, join the Bitcoin network), you begin to participate in a new form of money. One in which the rules are clear and you own your money. Not governments or banks. This allows you to… Save and invest BTC Unlike fiat currencies—which can be issued at will and lose value over time—bitcoin has a fixed, capped supply. There will only ever be 21 million. And no person, organization, bank, or government can change this. Due to this, some people see bitcoin as a savings vehicle and others see it as an investment. In developing countries, with low economic and political stability, some citizens resort to bitcoin to protect their money from hyper inflation and government oppression. With just their secret phrase (a series of 12-24 words), they can store their money somewhere that can’t be confiscated—in their mind and on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the developed world, Bitcoin is most often treated as an investment. Due to its fixed, capped supply, Bitcoin is scarce. It’s also governed by the law of supply and demand. So, if interest continues to rise, from retail and institutional investors, the price will too. With this in mind, many investors are pouring money into this digital asset to benefit from the expected appreciation and diversify their portfolios."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Ordinals (Bitcoin NFTs)", "output": "Long before Ethereum and Solana became known for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Bitcoin was the site of early NFT history. Projects like Colored Coins and Rare Pepes pioneered the digital art movement and paved the way for future NFT innovation. Although NFT activity on Bitcoin largely cooled down after this, it saw a resurgence in early 2023 with Ordinals, a novel form of NFTs native to the Bitcoin network. This development, by Casey Rodarmor, reinvigorated NFT development on Bitcoin and led to new fun use cases. Here are a few: Buy, sell, and trade NFTs Gone are the days of only HODLing bitcoin. Now, you can engage in NFT-related activities on Bitcoin too. On marketplaces such as Magic Eden, you’ll browse, buy, sell, and trade Bitcoin NFTs.

{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Bitcoin Name Service (BNS)", "output": "Bitcoin Name Service is a decentralized naming database on Bitcoin that supplies simple usernames that end in “.btc.” With these human-readable usernames, you can send and receive bitcoin and ordinals without dealing with long, complicated wallet addresses. Why does this matter? Because it’s faster, easier, and less prone to error. You don’t need to memorize complex wallet addresses or deal with the anxiety of inputting them correctly, character by character. Another cool aspect of BNS is that it’s customizable. Similar to website URLs or social media usernames, you can choose your username. DiamondHandz.btc? PayMeInBitcoin.btc? HODLgod.btc? Whatever name you want, it’s yours—as long as it’s available. This allows you to create and manage your digital identity, and shape how you’ll be perceived on the internet."}

The result is a faster, more efficient financial system that's available to anyone with an internet connection. Solana was built with DeFi in mind. Because of the blockchain’s ability to handle over 65,000 transactions per second (Visa supports 24,000 per second), Solana has attracted developers to create a range of powerful DeFi dApps that you can access right from your Phantom wallet. To get you started, Phantom brings you a fast and easy way to buy SOL, USDC, and USDT in-app. You can directly buy or transfer SOL using MoonPay or Coinbase accounts to your Phantom Wallet. Once you have SOL in your wallet, you can stake your SOL tokens directly from Phantom and earn more SOL in the process. Purchasing, swapping, and staking are three of the core mechanisms of the Solana blockchain and DeFi. Once you feel ready to graduate to more sophisticated applications, these are three powerful DeFi apps worth checking out: Orca Orca is an easy, fast, and user-friendly decentralized exchange on the Solana blockchain. In addition to low-fee, near-instant token swaps using an automated market maker (AMM) model, you're able to participate in the protocol by supplying liquidity (depositing pairs of tokens) to earn yield on token pairs. Mango Markets Mango Markets is another powerful decentralized exchange that allows you to lend, borrow, swap, and trade cryptoassets through a powerful risk engine. You can earn passive interest on deposits and trade both spot and future trading pairs. It's a powerful protocol for the DeFi power user. Solend Solend is a decentralized protocol for lending and borrowing on Solana. With Solend you can earn interest, borrow, leverage long, and short cryptoassets.

{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "What is Ethereum?", "output": "Launched in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, the Ethereum blockchain is a global software platform that allows users to hold virtual currencies, transact with them, and deploy decentralized applications. Ethereum was the first to introduce an innovation called smart contracts that allowed “programmable” money and applications. Smart contracts are digital agreements deployed on the blockchain that automatically execute when pre-defined conditions are met. Let’s understand this with an example — say you’re looking to take a loan from your bank. With a traditional bank, you’ve got to go through credit checks, fill out a bunch of paperwork, and deal with complex repayment terms. But not with DeFi. With DeFi, and smart contracts, you can get a loan anytime from anywhere without the need for approval from a central authority like a bank."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "What is ETH?", "output": "Ether (ETH) is the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain. Every transaction you make on the Ethereum network requires transaction fees as you’re using the network’s resources. These are called gas fees. Gas fees are distributed amongst network participants as rewards for dedicating their computing power to keep the network running. ETH is also used to transfer value between users of the blockchain. For instance, if you provide a service to a company, you can opt to use ETH as a payment method. Once you fulfill the agreement, the company will send you the set amount of ETH to your wallet."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "What are ERC-20 tokens?", "output": "ERC-20 tokens are the standard for creating fungible tokens or “digital currencies” on the Ethereum blockchain. Typically, ERC-20 tokens belong to a decentralized application — applications with smart contracts as their backend. ERC-20 tokens are “currencies” that are individual to each decentralized application and power the app economy for that application.

DEXs became popular due to the shortcomings of custodial centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Binance or Coinbase. CEXs act as a “custodian” or guardian for your crypto assets, similar to banks. However, that also means you are entrusting your money to a third-party — which can restrict or limit your access to your assets in case of problems.

{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Key takeaways:", "output": "Most crypto beginners start by opening an account on a crypto exchange like Coinbase. Although exchanges have become the go-to entry point for newcomers to web3, it's crucial to recognize the inherent risks associated with exchange wallets, as they exercise control over your assets. Opting for self-custody wallets like Phantom presents significant benefits, granting you complete authority over your crypto holdings and enabling seamless access to the vast landscape of web3 applications. In this article, we'll explain what a crypto wallet is, how it works, and how you can use it to protect your digital assets."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "What is a crypto wallet?", "output": "Crypto wallets are software tools that enable users to securely access, manage, and interact with their cryptocurrencies by storing their cryptographic keys. These cryptographic keys (also known as public and private keys) allow users to access digital assets on the blockchain."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "How do crypto wallets work?", "output": "Contrary to popular opinion, crypto wallets don’t actually “store your crypto.” Instead, they store your public and private keys, which let you access your crypto assets. When you sign up for a crypto wallet, two keys are created: a public key and a private key. Think of public keys as a mailbox where anyone can email you if they have its address. In contrast, private keys act as the “password” to this mailbox, and can access all stored emails or change its settings. Here’s an example of a public key on your Phantom wallet:"}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Custodial vs self-custody crypto wallets", "output": "Custodial and self-custodial wallets primarily differ in who owns the private key of your account. When you create an account on a crypto exchange, the exchange generates a wallet for you and holds your private key. In doing so, they act as the \"custodian\" of your wallet. However, this also means they have direct access to your funds, which could potentially be used for various purposes, such as lending or investing, without your explicit permission or knowledge. Some crypto exchanges have also been known to restrict withdrawals in case of market downturns. Self-custodial wallets are the solution to this problem. In self-custodial wallets, you have true ownership of your funds. No third party can access your private key, which means you’re responsible for storing and securing it."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Types of self-custody wallets and why use Phantom?", "output": "There are primarily two types of self-custodial wallets: hardware and software. Hardware wallets, like Ledger, are physical devices that generate and store your private keys offline.  While these wallets are typically adopted as long-term storage solutions, they require an upfront investment and are less convenient for day-to-day transactions. Phantom supports Ledger hardware wallets. Simply import your existing Ledger accounts and you’re ready to go. On the other hand, software wallets generate and store your private keys in the wallet itself, and offer a more convenient way to access your crypto. Software wallets exist as browser extensions and mobile apps. As a self-custodial software wallet, Phantom provides a safe and intuitive way to manage your assets, trade NFTs, and connect to your favorite dapps across Ethereum, Polygon, and Solana. Phantom is 100% free and offers a few key advantages that set it apart from other software wallets:"}

{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "What can you do with crypto wallets?", "output": "Since their inception, wallets have evolved significantly in terms of functionality and purpose. In the early days, wallets primarily served as secure storage for private keys, granting access to one's cryptocurrency assets. Today, however, wallets have become indispensable tools for engaging with a multitude of blockchain-based services and applications. They now act as gateways, enabling users to interact seamlessly with various aspects of the blockchain ecosystem."}

{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Key takeaways:", "output": "Crypto and volatility go hand in hand, right? Every time you invest in a digital asset, you're taking a gamble on the unpredictable price fluctuations. This can make it hard to time your investments and plan your portfolio. However, there's a class of crypto specifically designed to maintain a stable value: stablecoins. In this article, we’ll walk through what they are, why they matter, and how you can use them."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "What are stablecoins?", "output": "Stablecoins are relatively stable cryptocurrencies that work by pegging their value 1:1 to other assets like fiat currencies, gold, or other cryptoassets. That means you can exchange a stablecoin for an equivalent amount of the asset they're pegged to. For instance, USDT (or Tether) is pegged to the US dollar, which means every USDT can be exchanged for one dollar. There are quite a few innovative ways that stablecoins maintain their peg. Let’s look at some of them."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Types of stablecoins", "output": "There are different types of stablecoins based on methods used to stabilize their value: collateralized, algorithmic, and hybrid. Algorithmic stablecoins automatically adjust the supply based on demand for that coin. On the other hand, collateralized “traditional” stablecoins typically use reserves held by custodians or trustees. Hybrid stablecoins are a mix of both collateralized and algorithmic stablecoins. Each one has its own benefits and weaknesses, but for beginners, we recommend sticking with collateralized stablecoins as they're the most secure and widely-used. Let’s look at some of the most common collateralized stablecoins."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Fiat-Backed stablecoins", "output": "As the name suggests, fiat-backed stablecoins use fiat currencies like USD and EUR as collateral. The key advantage of these types of stablecoins is that they're backed by a central-bank-issued currency which is inherently resistant to volatility. The most popular fiat-backed stablecoins include USDC and USDT. Both these currencies have regulated entities in charge of the token supply and storage of the assets that back it. For USDC, this entity is the Massachusetts-based company Circle, and for USDT, it's the Hong-Kong based company iFinex."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Crypto-backed stablecoins", "output": "Crypto-backed stablecoins are backed by a reserve of other cryptocurrencies, instead of traditional assets like fiat currency or commodities. Usually, crypto-backed stablecoins use reputable cryptocurrencies like Ethereum or Bitcoin for their reserves to avoid volatility as much as possible. Further, they're typically over-collateralized, which means they keep more cryptocurrencies than the stablecoins they issue to account for fluctuations in price. For instance, a popular crypto-backed stablecoin is DAI. DAI is issued by MakerDAO and is backed by a pool of other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum. It uses smart contracts to automatically adjust the supply of DAI based on the value of its reserves."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "How stablecoins are used", "output": "Stablecoins act as a bridge between real world currencies and cryptocurrencies. Being able to rely on the value of a token to remain steady opens up a lot of possibilities in crypto."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Transfering and storing value", "output": "Stablecoins are used widely in payments and remittances. You can transfer money across borders without going through complex bank processes or high payment processor fees. Further, people in countries with unstable economies use stablecoins to store and transfer value as they are pegged to a more stable currency like the US dollar."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Trading crypto", "output": "In an industry where the market can go up and down quickly, stablecoins make trading easier. By being able to trade a volatile token for a stable one, stablecoins allow traders to maintain dollar-backed wealth within the cryptocurrency ecosystem, without using a traditional bank. Traders can sell cryptocurrencies for stablecoins to secure profits or use stablecoins to invest quickly at the right moment."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "DeFi", "output": "Stablecoins have become an important part of the DeFi ecosystem — like providing liquidity or collateral for borrowing and lending. The stability of stablecoins makes them an ideal form of collateral, as the lender can be confident that the value of the collateral will not suddenly drop."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Getting started with stablecoins", "output": "Ready to get started with stablecoins? Phantom’s makes it easy to purchase, sell, and swap USDC directly within the wallet.

{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Key takeaways", "output": "Web3’s decentralized nature has led to the emergence of many distinct blockchains and applications. For example, you can use decentralized finance (DeFi) applications on Ethereum, trade NFTs on Solana, or explore Polygon’s rapidly growing ecosystem. However, these blockchains are independent of each other, i.e., they can’t talk to each other. That's where bridges come in. Just like you exchange money while traveling to different countries, blockchain bridges allow you to transfer assets across various blockchains. Crypto bridges are the key to a connected, decentralized future, where assets and data flow freely across different platforms. In this article, we’ll explain what bridges are, how they work, and how you can get started."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "What are crypto bridges?", "output": "Crypto bridges are essentially software protocols that enable communication and interaction between different blockchains. Think of it as similar to building a bridge between two islands so people can travel back and forth. Crypto bridges allow two different blockchain networks to share information and work together. Crypto bridges work by establishing a connection between two different blockchain networks, allowing the transfer of assets and data between them. They do this by maintaining unified liquidity pools and unique resource balancing algorithms. These liquidity pools have native assets linked to all chains at the same time, allowing for efficient swaps. With crypto bridges, you can directly transfer your assets cross-chain with a few clicks. This helps you avoid the traditional process of sending assets to a centralized exchange, trading them for another asset and then withdrawing the asset. Crypto bridges, thus, eliminate any potential transaction delays and the need for trusting a centralized exchange. Further, since centralized exchanges typically charge a percentage of your assets to trade on them, you will also likely save on fees while using a decentralized bridge."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Accessing other blockchains and ecosystems", "output": "Crypto bridges provide a gateway to explore different blockchain ecosystems. This is especially useful when chains like Ethereum become congested due to high user activity. With bridges, you can simply move your assets to another network like Solana. By bridging your assets to Solana, you can take advantage of the lower transaction costs and faster transaction speeds. For instance, you can use decentralized apps (dapps), like Jupiter or Raydium on Solana instead of Ethereum after bridging your assets. This allows you to participate in DeFi activities, such as staking, liquidity provision, and trading, at a reduced cost compared to the Ethereum network. "}

{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Vulnerability Overview", "output": "With the \"Demonic\" vulnerability, users who imported their browser extension crypto wallet using a secret recovery phrase were at risk of having their secret recovery phrase exposed. If a sufficiently advanced attacker was able to exploit another vulnerability and obtain physical or logical access to the device, they would be able to retrieve the secret phrase and gain access to the wallet. Many major non-custodial cryptocurrency wallets with browser extensions were potentially affected by this issue, including Phantom, Metamask, Brave, and more. The discovery of \"Demonic\" revealed a new vector of attack for crypto wallets called key-finding. These attacks target the running memory of a process for specific sensitive credentials. Using the standard BIP39 mnemonic input field could make many browser extension wallets vulnerable to this type of attack."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Phantom’s Solution", "output": "We are ecstatic to welcome Oussama Amri, who originally discovered the threat last year while part of Halborn, to the Phantom team as a security engineer. And thanks to the hard work of engineers, Josiah Savary and Laamia Islam, not only have substantial parts of our codebase changed, but we have also completely rewritten how we generate seed phrases. After some additional audits are completed this summer, we plan to open-source our approach to the BIP-39 package for seed generation so other crypto wallets can also better protect themselves and their users. Please note that details of this vulnerability were kept confidential until all alerted parties could adequately address the threat. We are proud of the collaborative effort that went into keeping our users and the larger crypto community safe."}

This package includes starter files, setup and usage instructions, and a live demo showcasing multiple UI frameworks."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Connecting", "output": "The recommended and easiest way to connect to Phantom is by calling window.phantom.solana.connect(). However, the provider also exposes a request JSON RPC interface. The connect() call will return a Promise that resolves when the user accepts the connection request, and reject (throw when awaited) when the user declines the request or closes the pop-up. See Errors for a breakdown of error messages Phantom may emit. When the user accepts the request to connect, the provider will also emit a connect event. Once the web application is connected to Phantom, it will be able to read the connected account's public key and prompt the user for additional transactions. It also exposes a convenience isConnected boolean."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Eagerly Connecting", "output": "After a web application connects to Phantom for the first time, it becomes trusted. Once trusted, it's possible for the application to automatically connect to Phantom on subsequent visits or page refreshes, without prompting the user for permission. This is referred to as \"eagerly connecting\". To implement this, applications should pass an onlyIfTrusted option into the connect() call. If this flag is present, Phantom will only eagerly connect and emit a connect event if the application is trusted. If the application is not trusted, Phantom will throw a 4001 error and remain disconnected until the user is prompted to connect without an onlyIfTrusted flag. In either case, Phantom will not open a pop-up window, making this convenient to use on all page loads. The following is an example of how a React application can eagerly connect to Phantom. For a live demo, please refer to the handleConnect portion of our sandbox. If a wallet disconnects from a trusted app and then attempts to reconnect at a later time, Phantom will still eagerly connect. Once an app is trusted, Phantom will only require the user to approve a connection request if the user revokes the app from within their Trusted Apps settings."}

If accepted, Phantom will sign the transaction with the user's private key and submit it via a Solana JSON RPC connection. By far the easiest and most recommended way of doing this is by using the signAndSendTransaction method on the provider, but it is also possible to do with request. In both cases, the call will return a Promise for an object containing the signature. You can also specify a SendOptions object as a second argument into signAndSendTransaction or as an options parameter when using request.

The only difference is that developers should use the VersionedTransaction class rather than the Transaction class. The following example show how to build a simple transfer instruction. Once the transfer instruction is made, a MessageV0 formatted transaction message is constructed with the transfer instruction.

These structures can then be referenced to significantly increase the number of accounts that can be loaded in a single transaction. This lookup method effectively \"compresses\" a 32-byte address into a 1-byte index value. This \"compression\" enables storing up to 256 address in a single lookup table for use inside any given transaction. With the @solana/web3.js createLookupTable function, developers can construct the instruction needed to create a new lookup table, as well as determine its address. Once we have the lookup table instruction, we can construct a transaction, sign it, and send it to create a lookup table on-chain. Address lookup tables can be created with either a v0 transaction or a legacy transaction. However, the Solana runtime can only retrieve and handle the additional addresses within a lookup table while using v0 transactions. Here's a code snippet that creates a Lookup Table. Please refer to the handleSignAndSendTransactionV0WithLookupTable() in our code sandbox for a live demo of creating a lookup table."}

Marinade is Solana’s first-ever liquid staking solution. Founded in March 2021 at a DeFi hackathon, and funded via grants, this saucy provider delivered Solana’s first liquid staking token, mSOL, in August 2021. On Marinade, you stake your SOL and receive mSOL. As your staked SOL earns rewards, they’ll be distributed distributed directly into the price of mSOL. Next, is Jito, an MEV-powered liquid staking provider. When you stake with Jito, you receive yield-bearing JitoSOL and rewards in the form of points. Plus, the additional profits from Jito’s MEV validators are then redistributed to JitoSOL and its point program, which creates a positive flywheel. Lastly, a promising, newer Solana liquid staking option is SolBlaze. The SolBlaze stake pool works similarly to the ones from Marinade and Jito. But a key difference is that, when staking with SolBlaze, you don't receive mSOL or JitoSOL, but yield-bearing bSOL and its corresponding rewards. So, what’s the point? With the top Solana liquid staking providers, you can lock up your SOL and receive a liquid staking token (LST)—such as mSOL, JitoSOL, or bSOL—then deploy it in DeFi in search of greater returns."}

While we were able to help hundreds of thousands of users claim their airdrop, the massive usage overloaded our data infrastructure with too many concurrent connections. So, what happened? Several factors contributed to this issue. The huge spike in traffic exhausted our available connections to our database. This resulted in timeouts when attempting to connect to Allium, leading to over 20,000 concurrent Lambda executions. We then raised our concurrent execution limit to 30,000. Eventually, Allium increased its limits, and we re-deployed our Lambdas to clear idle connections, but problems persisted. After further investigation, we discovered that we had reached the limit of simultaneous connections through our NAT Gateway. In essence, our services reached the default AWS limit for simultaneous network connections. It seems these connections, or at least ports, remained in use even after the lambdas were cleaned up, extending the duration of the outage. This eventually resolved itself over time. While we did our best to prepare, this was a great learning lesson ahead of JUP."}

{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Introduction", "output": "Solana’s fast and cheap transactions make it the perfect testing ground for novel mobile applications. Until recently, however, there was no way for native mobile apps to interact with existing Solana wallets. In order to connect to users, Solana dapps had to be web-based. In a mobile context, these web dapps were most often viewed within a wallet’s in-app browser. All of this changed in Phantom v22.04.01 with the release of Phantom deeplinks. With deeplinks, iOS and Android apps can now interact directly with the Phantom mobile app to connect, sign, and send transactions. In this tutorial, we’ll walk through how you can integrate Phantom deeplinks into your Solana mobile application."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "What are deeplinks?", "output": "If you've ever created a link using an HTML <a> tag, you're probably familiar with the mailto: scheme. Unlike a normal url that directs users straight to a website (i.e. href=\"<https://google.com>\"), the mailto: scheme tells the operating system that it should instead open the email application. Once open, your email app can then parse the url to present a rich user experience. For example, the url href=\"mailto:[email protected]?subject=Deeplinking Tutorial Feedback&body=Hi Brian,\" will compose an email to me with both a subject and body already pre-configured. These url schemes are often referred to as deeplinks. Just like using the mailto: scheme, other applications can also link to each other by using their own custom url schemes. When developing a mobile application, we can specify our own protocol handler (such as: discord:// or phantom://) and create deeplinks that tell the operating system to open our native app. We can even take it a step further: using a concept known as universal links, we can create deeplinks based on regular https:// urls for a domain that we control. This comes with the added benefits of being more secure, as well as a better user experience in cases where users have yet to install our app. Phantom supports both universal links ( https://phantom.app/ul/ ) as well as a custom protocol handler (phantom:// ). For the remainder of this tutorial, we'll focus on Phantom's universal links and refer to these collectively as deeplinks."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "What we're building", "output": "To showcase the power of Phantom deeplinks, we'll be creating a mobile app that can interact with a program (aka smart contract) on Solana. Specifically, we’re going to be building a mobile-version of the movie reviews dapp from module 1 of the Solana Development Course. For the purposes of this tutorial, we won’t be writing any Solana programs ourselves. The Solana Development Course already does a great job of teaching that! Instead, we’ll be writing a mobile app that interacts with the course’s program which already exists on devnet. Once complete, our app will let users sign in and send reviews using Phantom. All in all, it'll look a little something like this:"}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Overview", "output": "This tutorial covers 3 main sections: Creating our mobile app using React Native and Expo CLI"}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Prerequisites", "output": "Before we can build anything, we first need to install the necessary command-line tools. Chief amongst these are Node.js and Expo CLI. If you don’t have Node yet, I recommend installing it via Node Version Manager (NVM). Before proceeding, you should be able to run the following commands in your terminal. I developed mine with the following versions: In addition to our laptop’s development environment, we’ll also want a phone to test our React Native app. One of the many benefits of Expo is that it makes it easy to test your app on a physical device throughout the development process. Before proceeding, make sure to install both the Expo and Phantom mobile apps from your phone’s official app store."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Scaffolding our React Native app", "output": "With the necessary tools installed, we can get started with our app. To recap: we’re going to be building a mobile app for the movie reviews program in the Solana Development Course. Instead of rehashing the lessons from that course, I’ve added the necessary components to a starter repo located on our GitHub. To get started, simply fork the repo and clone it to your local developer environment: Then, change into the project directory and install the necessary dependencies: Once you’ve installed the dependencies, you can fire up the app with: From here, your terminal should present you with a large QR code. Go ahead and grab your phone, open the camera app, and scan the QR code that is present on your laptop’s terminal. If you’re using an Android phone, you may need to scan it from within the Expo mobile app. If all goes well, your code should begin bundling and your phone will open the mobile app from the video above. Go ahead and try scrolling and searching within the app. If you’ve already completed the Solana Development Course’s module on Deserializing Custom Account Data, then this should look pretty familiar. Here, our app is fetching reviews from the course’s program and then paginating and filtering the results based on how far you scroll or what you search. If you take a look at our starter repo, you’ll see that the MovieList.tsx and MovieCoordinator.ts components from the course have already been integrated into our React Native app under the components directory. For the purposes of this tutorial, we won’t be going into detail over how these are working under the hood. If you’re interested in learning more here, be sure to check out the Solana Development Course! After playing around with our app, we can see that we’re already reading and displaying movies reviews that are stored on Solana. How would we go about adding new reviews? If you were to tap on the “Connect Phantom” button, you’ll see that nothing happens. Let’s see what’s going on by opening up the App.tsx file at the root of directory: We’ll be focusing mostly on this file for the majority of our walkthrough. Looking at our App.tsx component, you can see right off the bat that our app is looking to store a phantomWalletPublicKey. If we look down at what is returned from this component, you’ll see that if this phantomWalletPublicKey exists, we’ll render a button that lets us add a new movie review. Otherwise, we’ll return a “Connect Phantom” button:  We can also see that our connect function is currently lacking functionality: Let’s go ahead and change that!"}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Connecting our app to Phantom", "output": "When we first introduced the concept of deeplinking, we compared it to clicking on a mailto: link. In React Native, however, there are no <a> tags for us to work with. Instead, we can use the expo-linking package to create and open URLs from within our app. Let’s use this package to try and connect to Phantom from within our connect function. Taking a look at Phantom’s documentation, we can see that the URL needed to deeplink into Phantom’s connect method is: https://phantom.app/ul/v1/connect. Let’s try a naive approach by replacing our connect method with the following:  Turning back to our phone, let’s try tapping on our “Connect Phantom” button again. This time, we should instantly teleport over to our Phantom app. Pretty cool!"}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Handling Encryption", "output": "When using deeplinks, all communication between our app and Phantom will be encrypted by default. We can achieve this encryption via a simple key exchange known as Diffie-Hellman. In the same way that a Phantom user has a keypair made of up a public key (i.e. their Solana address) and a private key (managed by Phantom), our app will create its own keypair specific to its connection with Phantom. During a Diffie-Hellman exchange, our app will then share its public key in the initial connect request to Phantom. Once it receives our public key, Phantom will then generate its own keypair that’s unique to our app. When sending a connect response back to our app, Phantom will also share its corresponding public key with our app. Once both parties have each other’s public keys, they can then combine them with their own private keys that they did not share and end up with the same result. The beauty of this process is that while neither party shared any sensitive information (both only shared public keys), they can now reliably create the same secret that can be used for encrypting messages. We’ll refer to this secret as the shared secret."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Specifying Redirects", "output": "Whenever we make a deeplinking request to Phantom, we’ll also need to tell Phantom how to get back to our app. We can do this by creating our own set of deeplinks for our React Native app. Specifically, we can create a deeplink for receiving a Phantom connect event and include that as the redirect_link in our initial request. Once again, the expo-linking package can help us achieve this. First, we’ll need to specify our own app’s URL scheme, just like how Phantom specifies phantom://. We can do this from within our app.json file. Here, I’ve already set us up with deep-links-movie-tutorial://. Next, we’ll need to create the URL endpoint we want to pass as our redirect_link. Let’s call this onConnect. We can create this URL from within App.tsx like so: Now that we have a valid URL that Phantom can redirect back to, we’ll need a way for our app to actually listen for in-bound links. There are two scenarios in which our app could be opened with this link. In the first case, because our app is already open and running, we can simply listen for a url event and track the incoming URL: In the second scenario, we can’t rely on just listening for the event because our app may not already be open when the event is fired. To account for this, we should make sure we always call Linking.getInitialURL on our app startup: Finally, we’ll need some way of actually parsing the inbound link from Phantom and responding to it accordingly. Whenever we receive a deeplink that matches the onConnect URL we specified earlier, we know we’ll be dealing with a connect response. We can handle this like so:"}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Making a proper request to Phantom", "output": "Now that we have all of the necessary components, it’s time for us to make a proper connect request to Phantom. To recap, our connect request requires four parameters: When interacting with deeplinks, we can specify additional parameters by simply appending them to the base URL as query string parameters. Let’s put all these pieces together and try making a new connect request. Go ahead and update your App.tsx file with the following: Now, when we tap our “Connect Phantom” button, we should also see a connect modal pop up from within Phantom. When we approve this request by tapping “Connect”, Phantom should then redirect us back to our app. Progress!"}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Putting it all together", "output": "Let’s take a look at our console to see what Phantom is sending back to our app. If you take a look your console, you should see that we’re logging a URL that looks something like this: Recall that when we made our connect request to Phantom, we passed additional data such as our app_url and dapp_encryption_public_key as query string parameters. Now that we have a response, we can see that the URL we’re logging from Phantom also has additional data at the following query string parameters: Taking a closer look at these query string parameters, you’ll see now that all data from Phantom has been encrypted. In particular, the data field sent back from Phantom is now an encrypted JSON string. Let’s go ahead and decrypt it! When we made our connect request to Phantom, we passed along our dapp_encryption_public_key that Phantom could use to generate a shared secret on its side. Now that Phantom has passed us back its phantom_encryption_public_key, we can also generate this shared secret and complete the Diffie-Hellman key exchange needed to decrypt the data. We can do this by decoding the phantom_encryption_public_key received from Phantom and combining it with our app’s dappKeyPair.secretKey like so: Moving over to our utils folder, let’s create a new file named decryptPayload.ts and add the following function: Here, we’re creating a helper function that will decrypt a given data string using the sharedSecret we just generated in our Diffie-Hellman key exchange and the nonce passed back from Phantom. With this method now in place, we can now decrypt the data passed back from Phantom: Taking a look at our console, we should see that our app has decoded the data from Phantom to an object that has public_key and session fields: Here, the public_key that Phantom passes us is the public key of the end user. The session we receive is specific to this user and represents our user’s connection to our app. Our app should continue to pass this session param back to Phantom to authenticate all subsequent requests. As long as this session is valid, we should consider this user “connected” to our app. With this data now decrypted, we can go ahead and store both the public_key and session received from Phantom. Let’s update our App.tsx file with the following:  Now, when we approve our connect request, our app should recognize that the request was successful and render “Add Review” and “Disconnect” buttons. We’re now officially connected!"}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Notes on Sessions", "output": "From here on out, all communication with Phantom will require the session param that our app has stored. This session does not expire, and will represent our connection to Phantom until it is deemed invalid. There are two scenarios in which a session can be deemed invalid: In cases where our app loses this session (such as if a user force closes our app) we should simply consider the user disconnected and require a new connection before continuing."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Disconnecting From Phantom", "output": "Before we continue on to adding movie reviews to our app, we should also give our users a way to disconnect. Disconnecting follows much of the same process as connecting. Namely, we will make a deeplink to Phantom that: We’ve already covered most of the heavy lifting here in our initial connect request. To set ourselves up for future requests, let’s refactor some of our existing connect logic. First, let’s add the following line to our constants/index.ts file: Next, create a new file within our utils folder named buildUrl.ts and add the following function. This will make it easier for us to construct different Phantom deeplinks in the future: If we take a look at the query string parameters required for disconnect, we can see that most of it looks similar to our initial connect request. This time, however, we will also need to encrypt a payload in our request to Phantom. Remember, our encrypted channel with Phantom works both ways! To set ourselves up for encrypting future requests, let’s create a new file under our utils folder named encryptPayload.ts and add the following: Here, we’re using the sharedSecret we generated from our Diffie-Hellman key exchange to encrypt some arbitrary payload that we will send to Phantom. As part of this encryption process, we’ll also generate a nonce that we’ll send to Phantom so that Phantom can decrypt our payload. Switching over to our App.tsx file, we can now add the necessary components to make a disconnect deeplink and handle its corresponding redirect link back from Phantom. First, we’ll need to create a redirect link: Then, we’ll need a way to handle this incoming redirect link. In the case of disconnect, Phantom doesn’t return us anything—we should simply forget our users phantomWalletPublicKey as our session would no longer be valid: With our redirect route in place, we can finally build and open our disconnect deeplink. Note that we are encrypting a payload to Phantom that includes our session param from earlier. We will need to pass this to Phantom to authenticate all subsequent requests! Once all this in place, our app should be able to quickly connect and disconnect like so:"}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Signing and sending transactions via Phantom", "output": "Now that our users can connect and disconnect from our app, we’re finally ready to give them the ability to write their own movie reviews. So far, we’ve just been reading reviews created by other people who have interacted with the program that’s already on devnet. Now, our users can write their own reviews and use Phantom to broadcast them to the network. If you tap on our existing “Add Review” button, you’ll see a form pop up that asks for a movie’s title, review, and rating. All of this is already set up for us within components/AddReviewSheet.tsx. I won’t rehash everything in here, since the Solana Development Course already does a great job of explaining how to interact with their existing program. If we look at our handleSubmit function, however, we can see that we’re already constructing our review as a TransactionInstruction and then packaging it into a Transaction. This transaction now needs to be signed and submitted to the Solana network. Let’s zoom back out to our App.tsx file. Here, we’ll need to add much of the same deeplinking flows that we’ve already covered. Specifically, we’ll need: Go ahead and try your hand at implementing the first two items from our list above. Afterwards, scroll down to find our signAndSendTransaction method. Here, we can add the necessary logic to pass our transaction to Phantom so that it can be signed and submitted to the network:"}

Otherwise, we conclude that the session has been faked, as the signature does not belong to the keypair it claims it does. After we determine that the session is valid, we still need to ensure that the JSON fields line up with what we expect. An app could give a session for pubkey A when the user is currently using pubkey B in Phantom. In such a scenario, that session should not allow an app to request signatures.

Then we will initialize our PhantomConnector Now the last thing to do is invoke the useWeb3React hook and set up the connection logic in the app. Your entire App.tsx file should look like this Here you can see that we're using the Phantom connector, and passing it as an argument to the useWeb3React activate and disconnect hooks that we initialized. There are other hooks that you can pull in from useWeb3React that will track various things, such as the chain id or connection status. Here in this app we just track the account which is the address of the wallet that's currently connected.

The rest of the component is calling the hooks to get the relevant status connection,  address, and chain id.

{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Introduction", "output": "Wallet Standard is a chain-agnostic set of interfaces and conventions that aim to improve how applications interact with injected wallets such as Phantom. The standard was pioneered on Solana and is used as the foundation for the Solana Wallet Adapter. Phantom supports the Wallet Standard and is open to working with others to bring this innovation to other ecosystems."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Motivation", "output": "Most desktop wallets today come in the form of browser extensions. These extensions interact with dApps by injecting code in the form of a provider into every website the user visits. There are several issues with the way injection works today: While wallets often injected into their own designated namespace (e.g. window.phantom), there is nothing stopping another wallet from injecting into the same namespace. Furthermore, any wallet can attempt to mimic another by changing its identifier flags (e.g. window.solana.isPhantom = true). As a result, users who have multiple injected wallets can often experience unwanted interferences. Since wallets attach themselves to the window as global objects, dApps need to be made aware of how they can find these objects. Instead of automatically detecting all wallets that the user has installed, a dApp must choose to support a limited number of wallets that may not be relevant to the user. Wallets inconsistently support features such as signing and sending transactions, signing more than one transaction, signing a \"message\" (arbitrary byte array), and encryption and decryption. To the extent they support these features, wallets may have different interfaces which can make integrations complex and time consuming."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Wallet-Standard Overview", "output": "Wallet Standard addresses these issues by introducing an event-based model that At a high-level, Wallet Standard defines the following Window interface for events: When a wallet is ready to inject into a website, it will dispatch a register-wallet event and listen for an app-ready event. Conversely, an app will dispatch an app-ready event and listen for register-wallet events."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Features of Wallet Standard", "output": "Before Wallet Standard, if a dApp wanted to support 20 wallets, it had to load 5kb of code per wallet (100k total). This bloating increases linearly as the number of wallets increase. The vast majority of this code goes unused, as the user will only use one or two wallets. Wallet Standard turns this inside out: If dapps want to support 100 wallets, they just to support Wallet Standard. Any wallet that supports the standard is will automatically be detected and supported. Implementations are replaced with interfaces. Before Wallet Standard, every new wallet had to land a PR in a library such as the Solana Wallet Adapter. Library maintainers had to vet hundreds of PRs to ensure they weren't introducing malware into the adapter. By eliminating plugins, these libraries can now eliminate attack surfaces. While Wallet Standard was pioneered on Solana, it is chain-agnostic by default. An example EIP-1193 implementation can be found here. Wallet Standard will always input and output transactions, pubkeys, and signatures as raw bytes (Uint8Array). As such, there are no dependencies for web3.js ."}

If a Fungible token does not have an on-chain Metadata Account, Phantom will fallback to displaying data from the Solana Labs Token List. This list is considered deprecated and should not be used to host new tokens. When reading from the token list, Phantom will display the following fields: Phantom will display prices for any token that is verified on Coingecko. When verifying with Coingecko, be sure to include the token's contract. For Solana tokens, this should be the mint address. For example, Bonk is verified with the contract DezXAZ8z7PnrnRJjz3wXBoRgixCa6xjnB7YaB1pPB263. Once a token has verified its contract address with Coingecko, Phantom will automatically begin displaying its price.
