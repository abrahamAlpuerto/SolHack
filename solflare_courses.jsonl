{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: DeFi Foundations", "input": "Blockchain Basics", "output": "Blockchainsare ever-expanding ledgers of transactions. They have a handful of qualities that differentiate them from traditional computing networks, and they open doors to entirely new ways of doing things. They’re intended to becensorship-resistant,immutablerecord sources withinteroperablecapabilities. Immutable in the sense that these transactions can not be reversed and interoperable in the sense that blockchain accounts can seamlessly interact with other accounts and applications. Transactions on a blockchain are grouped into blocks and are verified by adistributednetwork of computers that earn money for participating in the verification process. The term distributed refers to the idea that these computers are not governed by any central entity but rather a widespread collection of individual entities. This network collectively puts together a public ledger that can be indexed and searched with extreme detail. Anything that happens on a public blockchain is immediately and immutably a part of the public record. Each account on a blockchain is accessed with a digital wallet. Accounts hold an individual or entity’s tokens which can be freely transferred between wallets and interact with applications that are compatible with the wallet. These applications can be financial or used for gaming, messaging, and virtually anything else. When proper security measures are practiced, only a wallet user has access to its contents. For a deeper dive into non-custodial wallets, check out this article from Solflare’s Knowledge Base. Unlike traditional markets, blockchains operate at all hours of the day, so on-chain markets are running 24/7, and transactions can’t be reversed. Anyone with a wallet can partake in them, and all transactions are final."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: DeFi Foundations", "input": "Blockchain Characteristics", "output": "The following properties are fundamental qualities that public blockchains possess to varying degrees. There are open and closed-source private blockchains, but those are custom-made and built to cater to a centralized company likeJPM Chase. While some blockchains areforks– or replicas – of others, most are built differently and each of their immutable, interoperable, capable, and permissionless qualities will differ."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: DeFi Foundations", "input": "Digital Economies", "output": "When you combine the above ingredients into a network of people and computers worldwide, you begin opening the door to a new paradigm. A paradigm where banks and brokers don’t stand between you and your money. A paradigm where algorithms verify and prove that events took place rather than you having to trust a banker, broker, or government entity. Blockchains can’t lie. Using the tools of self-custody and non-custodial wallets, individuals can now be their banks and brokers. All they need to do is generate a digital wallet like Solflare. Digital wallets are cryptographically secure locations for you to interact with your digital assets, and they can be accessed with 12-24 word mnemonic phrases, known colloquially as recovery phrases or seed phrases.Anyone with a wallet’s phrase can access the said wallet, so it’s imperative that only you have access to your wallet.Learn more about recovery phrases at the link below. You can store a near-infinite amount of cryptocurrencies and NFTs (non-fungible tokens) in a single wallet. Using a single recovery phrase, you can generate and access a near-infinite amount of wallets.These wallets don’t store your assets but are an interface for you to interact with them.Blockchain assets are on-chain at all times, so as long as you have access to your wallet and the blockchain you use is working, you’ll have access to your digital assets. Let that sink in. It’s not hard to realize how profound this is. Rather than carry $100,000,000 in cash, you can now remember a 12-24 word phrase that gives you access to a digital wallet with 100,000,000 USDC in it, and no one can ever take that from you – unless you get scammed or give away your secret phrase. USDC is a stablecoin that attempts to retain parity with the dollar, so 1 USDC = $1. If USDC were to depeg, then that’d be an issue. Such was the case withUST, adecentralizedalgorithmic stablecoin."}

While there have been many attempts at creating decentralized computing networks such as Tor, there has never been a network with an ingrained digital currency that was able to preventdouble-spendingfrom happening. There were no decentralized computing networks with blockchain functionality until Bitcoin came around. Bitcoin, as a cryptocurrency, only exists because of the underlying Bitcoin blockchain that continuously verifies transactions and adds newblocksto itsdistributed ledger. As its value increased by over 83,000,000% in a decade, an entire industry formed around it and stands at the bleeding edge of technology, finance, game theory, and distributed systems. Some of its earliest projects were MakerDAO and Ethereum."}

While maximalism stands to reason if one wants to avoid scams but its surprising that so many think the first iteration of a new technology is the best. Would you fly in the Wright Brothers’ plane? Nothing in crypto today would exist without Bitcoin, but there is room for more than one digital asset. Bitcoin is used to pay for transaction fees on the Bitcoin blockchain in the same way that other cryptocurrencies are used to pay for transactions on other blockchains, such as Ethereum."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: DeFi Foundations", "input": "Ethereum", "output": "Ethereum has a long and colorful history that is expertly outlined inThe Infinite Machine: How an Army of Crypto-hackers Is Building the Next Internet with Ethereum. Refer to that text, or to a similar book,The Cryptopians: Idealism, Greed, Lies, and the Making of the First Big Cryptocurrency Crazefor a thorough account of Ethereum. For the scope of this course, it’s important to understand that Ethereum and a new programming language called Solidity were developed to serve as a global settlement layer and to enable developers to build any complete program or protocol on top of it. This is a vague and ambiguous way of describing the function of what you can do with a distributed ledger – or a database. The programs themselves can be simple protocols that let you buy a jpeg image or trade the Ethereum cryptocurrency for another token, or they can be complicated financial wizardry that is difficult to explain. Ethereum has a long and colorful history that is expertly outlined inThe Infinite Machine: How an Army of Crypto-hackers Is Building the Next Internet with Ethereum. Refer to that text or a similar book,The Cryptopians: Idealism, Greed, Lies, and the Making of the First Big Cryptocurrency Craze, for a thorough account of Ethereum. For the scope of this course, it’s essential to understand that Ethereum and a new programming language called Solidity were developed to serve as a global settlement layer and to enable developers to build any complete program or protocol on top of it. This is a vague and ambiguous way of describing the function of what you can do with a distributed ledger – or a database. The programs can be simple protocols that let you buy a jpeg image or trade the Ethereum cryptocurrency for another token. They can be complicated financial wizardry that is difficult to explain. Ethereum developers built a series of protocols compiled into the ERC20 standard. ERC20 refers to the fungible token standard on Ethereum. Ethereum, unlike Bitcoin, lets you develop and release any customized token. The economics of the token – the distribution schedule, etc. – is referred to as tokenomics. Ethereum hit the ground running in 2014, and by 2017, a massive bubble had inflated around ERC20 token raises. Companies were issuing tokens in exchange for Ethereum or other cryptocurrencies by making an ICO – an initial coin offering. It’s comparable to traditional finance’s IPO – an initial public offering but requires far less due diligence and regulatory oversight. As a result of this craze, Bitcoin and Ethereum hit fresh all-time highs as retail investor demand went through the roof. It’s clear now that many of the companies involved in the 2017 debacle were fraudulent or inadequate. Still, at the time, they were taking advantage of a novel and unregulated technology very early in its infancy. The internet’s dot com bubble in the early 2000s had a similar effect. Greedy people saw smart people making money and tried to get in on it. From 2017 to now, prices have been volatile, but builders have kept building. Ethereum has boasted a hefty$160 billionworth of digital assets on-chain at its peak and continuously confirmsover a million transactions per day. Ethereum, and all blockchains, are known asLayer 1s. They are the ultimate settlement layer on which all applications are built. When referring to Layer 1s that arenotBitcoin or Ethereum, industry pundits call themAlt Layer 1s. These blockchains may offer outsized rewards with a more considerable risk involved or be defunct and bereft of users. The classic alt layer one trade in 2021 wasSoLunAvaxwhich referred to buying and holding the Solana coin, Luna coin, and Avax (Avalanche) coin. Solana is thriving and has healthy organic growth metrics. Avalanche has a reasonably robust community. Unfortunately, Luna went to zero in 2022, bringing it down roughly $60 billion worth of value (UST and LUNA). Read more about Luna’s downfall here. New blockchains usually have no interest in being like Bitcoin. They’re usually variations of Ethereum’s structure (referred to as EVM compatible – Luna, Avax, Near, etc.), or they’re looking to iterate on other blockchain architecture (Solana) and consistently begin with building what become known as the DeFi stack. We’ll go over that in the next chapter."}

{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Onboarding to DeFi", "input": "You’re Still Early", "output": "Traditional finance as we understand it has only existed since the birth of the Federal Reserve and, more accurately, since the onset of theBretton Woodsagreement – and even more accurately, since the start of quantitative easing practices resulting from the Great Financial Crisis and the Covid 19 response. Roughly 60% of all $ was put into circulation within the past few years. That changes things. Compared to other fields, traditional finance is not that traditional – its fundamental structure has only been in place for about 80 years, which is considered modern compared to the humanities. Finance is grossly behind where it needs to be compared to scientific fields like medicine and chemistry. As referenced in Chapter 2, traditional finance today is about as evolved as 16th-century chemistry was. It’s full of alchemy. The cutting edge of traditional finance could be more cutting edge. FinTech technologies like mobile-only banking apps or buy-now-pay-later schemes such asKlarnaare not revolutionary. They’re simply byproducts of what’s possible with a mobile phone. Compared to the constant innovation at the cutting edge of DeFi and blockchain technology, traditional finance’s innovation over the past few decades is insignificant."}

{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Onboarding to DeFi", "input": "Risk", "output": "Risk works as a stairway on the way up and an elevator on the way down. When sh*t hits the fan, all correlations go to one. These two concepts explain your average investor’s mindset when it comes to risk. The low-risk, low-return, and high-risk, high-return framework have become the de facto understanding of risk for investors over time, and DeFi is no different. Risks in DeFi come in many shapes and sizes, some new and some old. These risks range from smart contract risk (lousy code) to user error (forgetting one’s mnemonic) and everything in between. DeFi and the rest of crypto are highly correlated withrisk-on-techassets. Along with the standard volatility of risk-on tech assets, DeFi users must understand that DeFi is very volatile. There are small-scale scams and large-scale hacks taking place very often, and regulators need to learn how to deal with it all and often can’t go after what they need to. If you want to understand examples of these hacks, go throughRekt’s graveyard. They’re actively going after people and have started sanctioning protocols likeTornado Cashto prevent bad actors from siphoning money into untraceable wallets. To go after a protocol in this manner would require smart contracts to be sanctioned, which is explained further below byHarry.eth, a security researcher fromMetamask. There is even a state-sponsored hacking group calledLazarusthat operates in North Korea, which has attempted toinfiltratecrypto companies and has stolen hundreds of millions, if not billions, over the past few years by exploiting blockchain applications and bridge vulnerabilities. It’s theorized that these funds are being used to fund North Korea’s nuclear program. This isn’t the wild wild west but it’s definitely not for the faint of heart.

{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Onboarding to DeFi", "input": "High Beta Assets", "output": "When an asset moves in a similar direction as another, it’s said to becorrelated. When one asset consistently moves in the same direction as another but with more significant moves, it’s said to have ahigh beta. When the Nasdaq 100, an index of the top 100 US tech companies, is up 3%, you’ll probably see Bitcoin up 10% and vice versa. This is to say thatcryptocurrencies are high-beta digital assets highly correlated to risk-on-tech assets. These extremes make it easy for people to make AND lose money. Best practices in crypto are to never recommend buying to family members or friends who wouldn’t know what they’re doing. You don’t want to be that guy/girl when prices decide to go the wrong way.

In fact, go ahead and follow no-coiners and othercrypto critics. Some podcasts and individuals make a living pointing out everything wrong with crypto. These people will open your mind to how non-crypto people view blockchain technology (tl;dr, they usually hate it). In the ways that some people are religious zealots for Bitcoin, there are also religious zealots for anti-crypto belief systems. Please refer to F. Scott Fitzgerald’s quote in Chapter 5 to understand what both examples of zealots lack."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Applications", "input": "Today’s Agenda", "output": "We’re covering lots of surface area here. Each of the topics listed below is entire sub-industries within crypto. While a growing number of people devote every day and every dollar to DeFi, NFTs, and DAOs, the segment of the population who is even aware of how to use them is still relatively small. As global adoption metrics, security practices, and education improve, that number will increase. Other than on crypto exchanges, Blockchain applications are where most of the activity in crypto occurs. Apps are built directly on top of a blockchain and will utilize its settlement layer to perform their functions. They can be anything from a messaging service to a trading platform, andon-chain activityrefers to transactions occurring across various applications on various blockchains. An on-chain transaction doesn’t always involve a transfer of value or funds. Trades can also relay messages, cast votes and serve other non-financial purposes. There are thousands of apps built across dozens of blockchains, andmost of their utility and function can be categorized into the DeFi, NFT, or DAO industries. Some apps help users earn yields of billions of dollars, while others are built purely to serve as infrastructure, such as bridges between different blockchains. New types of apps likeLens, an on-chain social network, andRabbit Hole, an on-chain credentialing service, are taking off in popularity, and it will be interesting to see how burgeoning sub-industries like the digital fashion and decentralized science movements evolve.They’re similar to regular websites but use blockchains, a totally different framework than the regular internet,so their capabilities differ. For the purpose of this course, you need to understand the following:"}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Applications", "input": "The Fallacy of Right Click & Saving", "output": "People love to ask NFT owners, “If I right-clicked and saved a screenshot of an NFT, wouldn’t that be the same thing as owning it?” That question is baseless, given the nature of owning digital assets on a blockchain, so it’s best practice not to ask it. These apes are not being compared to the Mona Lisa but from a financial and philosophical perspective –owning a copy of the Mona Lisa is not the same as owning the Mona Lisa.The above question becomes incredibly hackneyed when you consider that NFTs can represent real-world assets. Propy, for example, lets you tokenize the deed to your house and sell it on a blockchain as an NFT. No 30-day closing period is required."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Applications", "input": "DAOs: Decentralized Autonomous Organizations", "output": "Blockchain applications that fit into these three categories include even more sub-categories than what’s been listed. Still, for the scope of the next chapter, we’re focusing on DeFi applications – in particular, DEXes (Decentralized Exchanges). DEXes are an aspect of the DeFi world that enables, here’s this word again,permission-lesstransactions of digital assets. The way they do so is relatively complex, so we’ll deal with that in another course. Let’s discuss why this concept of permissionlessness keeps coming up."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Applications", "input": "Permission", "output": "The idea of asking for permission to make a transaction sounds a bit odd, but it is what 99.9% of the world is doing. The other 0.1% is taking part in DeFi or a barter network. In a barter network, you act within a P2P (Peer to Peer) framework with no central intermediary. If I have 10 chickens but want 1 cow, and you have 1 cow but want 10 chickens, and we both value 10 chickens per 1 cow, I can trade my chicken to you for your cow, and we’ll both be happy. DeFi enables this same P2P framework but in the context of digital assets. Let’s take the DEX mentioned above example. DEXes enable the permissionless transaction of digital assets by implementing liquidity pools. Liquidity pools are effective services governed by on-chain software that facilitate the transfers ofliquidity, or on-hand capital, that traders can use to make trades. There is no company and no CEO involved with any transaction on a DEX, so no company or CEO canstopany transaction. These liquidity poolsdon’tjust close at 4 PM ET like the New York Stock Exchange does. They are 24/7 mechanisms that exist as long as the blockchain they are on exists. They are a series of processes, otherwise known as a protocol, and many can exist without human input or monitoring. When compared to a CEX (centralized exchange), DEXes are revolutionary. Rather than deal with 5-10 various TradFi intermediaries to handle your funds and trade lifecycles for you, you can do it all on your own. These 5-10 intermediaries cause many issues that make finance less transparent, less democratic, and more counterparty-dependent. Blockchains aim to eliminate this dependence by serving as immutable sources of record on which other applications, like DEXes, can base their activity. The DEX doesn’t have to worry about who’s in the custody of your assets because only you can be unless you lose yourmnemonic/recovery phrase."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Applications", "input": "Regulatory Uncertainty and Counterparty Risk", "output": "In TradFi, your location may restrict you from accessing certain services, like crypto derivatives in the USA. US crypto traders are given a different opportunity than non-US crypto traders, and the reasons behind that are reasonably nuanced. Long story short, US agencies like the SEC are not transparent with their opinions. As a result, crypto exchanges want to avoid getting in trouble in the future, so they generally don’t offer derivatives or as many token listings in the US as they do internationally. This regulatory framework ultimately hurts US investors as they are left with a small selection of tokens to choose from and disingenuous public market instruments like an ETF of futures contracts following BTC’s price. The regulatory uncertainty also impacts the country’s economy as a whole, as developers and other human resources are gravitating towards and generating economic value in regions with favorable regulations. This concept, known asjurisdictional arbitrage, is a growing trend in this digital age. It’s an example of a second-order effect of slow and backward policies. If your location doesn’t seem like an issue in your investing activities, you still have a lot to deal with. The grossly misrepresented and excessive counter-party risk in traditional finance became evident throughout the 2008 financial crisis. Of course, many factors were at play, but there’s no doubt that the contagion of collateralized debt obligations, worth around $2 trillion, set the recession in motion. This debt, secured against thousands of low-quality residential mortgages that ultimately defaulted, generated enormous counter-party risk that the system could not handle whenthe music stopped. In other words,there were massive checks but no balances."}

Evidence of that is new international reserve currencies come about every few centuries. Billionaire investor and Bitcoin advocateRay Dahlio– among others, theorizes that the current reserve status of the USD is declining and that other currencies will rise in global prominence.

Peter argues that the global macroeconomic environment has moved into an unprecedented territory and that the previous framework won’t accommodate what will happen. Also compelling.

{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Essential Technologies", "input": "Expansion Beyond Ethereum", "output": "Development on Ethereum skyrocketed during DeFi Summer as the number of new protocols being released into the wild was massive. A group of protocols, including DEXes, lending and borrowing, and yield farming, became the standard stack on each new chain that DeFi was being built on. Ethereum’s transaction fees, called Gas, became much higher due to demand – Ethereum can only handle about 12-20 transactions per second which led to many protocols expanding beyond Ethereum. Some protocols exclusively remained on Ethereum, while others expanded to newlayer 1sthat were gaining traction.Sushi, for example, is one of the protocols that started on Ethereum and has since become available on 14 other blockchains orlayer two scaling solutions(defined below).

Before liquid staking, one of its downsides was that a staked asset was notliquid. It could not be used as collateral or traded for something else—cue liquid staking. Liquid staking is the process of obtaining a liquid I-owe-you token that is supposed to trade on parity with the underlying asset being staked. This liquid token represents the illiquid coin/token that is staked.

They are somewhat controversial because a few major hacks have occurred on bridges. After all, they are large targets. The standard bridge consists of the token being transferred from one blockchain to another, being locked up andwrapped. Moving Ethereum tokens to the Solana blockchain, for example, requires the Ethereum tokens to be wrapped and distributed as WETH for them to function on Solana. The actual ETH is still locked up within the bridge’s smart contracts and is only released upon the relinquishment/burning of the WETH. Arguments for bridges are primarily based on the idea that blockchains will scale if they’re interoperable together, meaning their assets can freely move between each other. Arguments against bridges, like those made by Ethereum’s founderVitalik Buterin, are primarily based on the idea that they’re not necessary nor safe. Examples:Portal,Swim"}

Still, they’re often opaquely derived and don’t accurately represent the financial realities taking place – which is the point of all accounting. One metric you will see everywhere istotal value locked (TVL). TVL is a good metric for certain things within certain types of applications, but the way it’s measured matters more than anything else. It can easily be gamed to show activity or liquidity that isn’t there.ThisCoinDesk article breaks down an example of dubious developers implementing double counting mechanisms in their TVL calculation which skewed the data to misrepresent the actual amount of capital involved. It makes you wonder how many protocols are being honest about their TVL calculations when you look at DeFi Llama’s cross-chain TVL aggregation dashboard. More relevant metrics need to be standardized and used across similar types of applications to avoid more misleading accounting practices. Yield farming protocols have different architectures than decentralized fund management protocols and thus need different standardized metrics measuring different things. These different things are currently non-standard because they’re new and still being developed. As with any new technology, standardization will come with time."}

Theoretically, a barter system could work on a small scale but can’t support global trade or commerce. For the last century, the US dollar (USD) has become the standard store of value, unit of account, and medium of exchange for the whole world.

Considering the relative position of every other country in the world, it’s easy to understand why the US is so influential in world affairs. The US has more money to spend than any other country and has the world’s most prominent military presence backing it up. While the USisn’t even closeto being the country with the most wealth inequality, 1% still owns 30% of the wealth and16x more than the bottom 50%. To support the massive amount of assets within the American financial industry, there needs to be an enormous amount of infrastructure – and there is. There’s Wall Street, the Federal Reserve (12 branches), the US Treasury, the SEC, the CFTC, the ACH network, the SWIFT network, banks, credit bureaus, insurance companies, more regulatory agencies, auditing firms, securities brokers, the buy side, the sell side, short sellers, the NYSE, CBOE, CME, and more.

Federal employees and global news pundits will cite economic theories and papers from reputable universities written about, for example –Modern Monetary Theory(MMT) – as a basis for their policy choices. MMT includes justifications for excessive money printing, which has directly aligned with the Federal Reserve’s strategy of quantitative easing and economic stimulus packages. It is strongly contested by proponents of other economic perspectives, such as theAustrianschool of economics.

{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Money", "input": "Bretton Woods", "output": "The position of the US in the global economy is only 78 years old. In 1944, the US, Canada, Australia, Japan, and several western European countries convened in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, to configure a new monetary order. The US was far and away in a position of dominance since the European powers were fragile due to WW2 battles and bombings taking place on their soil. Representatives from around the world were consensually coerced into agreeing to the US’s pitch of how global monetary relations should function. The consequences of Bretton Woods were the beginning formation of many reconstruction efforts such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the US dollar) becoming the de factoreserve currencyfor US-protected global trade. This global world order has benefited billions but has caused adverse second-order effects. The financial markets and financial services industries were not exempt from such developments. As markets expanded, so did their opaqueness due to more financial intermediaries/middlepeople being introduced. Modern traditional financial practices are obsolete compared to the immutable transparency possible with blockchain technology today. Benoit Mandelbrotobserved that based on their relative ages, you can compare financenowto where chemistrywasin the 16th century from an evolutionary perspective. Since that’s the case, financial alchemy is a portion of what goes on within traditional finance. Alchemy was the pseudoscience and speculative philosophy, the medieval forerunner to modern chemistry. In other words, some of what goes on behind the scenes are not in your best interest. In the past 78 years, countries like the US, Germany, China, and Singapore have risen to become world powers, while many other economies have yet to fully develop. Economists often break the world into 3 parts –developed,emerging, andfrontier. Crypto’s role drastically differs in each, for now."}

In other words, you don’t have to think the world’s financial system will crumble if you believe in crypto but more often than not, people who do think thatalsodo believe in crypto. It’s a nuance that’s difficult to explain but makes a major difference. Suppose you peruse Twitter, Reddit, or other online threads about crypto. You’ll likely find people talking about how the USD will be debased, how BTC will become the world’s future reserve currency, or how dumb people in crypto are for thinking these things. Gold bugs have felt this way for centuries. If you’re a gold bug in a country like Argentina or Turkey, where your domestic currency experiences hyperinflation regularly, then you’re hailed as a genius. If you’re a gold bug in the US, where you can safely store your USD in a bank controlled by arm guards, then you’re a wackadoodle. When Bitcoin hit the scene in 2008, along with the enshrined headline by a British daily that read, “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on the brink of second bailout for banks” inBitcoin’s Genesis Block, it made waves. This was the first asset that was effectively un-seizable (without a$5 wrench)and from its very first moment, it absorbed and created the underlying counterculture to traditional finance. Because of the complicated nature of developed markets, developed financial systems are bureaucratic and, on the whole, challenging to change. Both the obsolete and practical assortments of systems that have been in place for decades are generally skeptical when it comes to change. It’s perfectly natural for large systems to reject change as it is essentially a threat to the market participants within the prevailing system. Unless the US financial system fails, outright alternatives like DeFi will likely remain a fringe activity for the foreseeable future. There will probably be DeFi integrations across many sectors within the US economy, but in terms of a total overhaul of the payment rails for the whole world, that’s quite the uphill battle.Even if the dollar went to zero tomorrow, there are still trillions in American real estate, intellectual property, weapons, and physical goods that underly the US economy. These assets would still have value; they would need to be valued in a new currency.For these reasons and many more, DeFi’s most considerable impacts will likely be felt within the emerging and frontier markets."}

It’s in these regions where DeFi is already proving its use case, although more of the world who need it is not using it. For those who do, it’s the only option to properly utilize money’s 3 value propositions. Without a stable mechanism like the USD to perform those duties, individuals and corporations are subject to volatile fluctuations of their assets and net worth, which prevent an economy from functioning correctly. According to the US Federal Reserve, the US had22%of its adults unbanked or underbanked in 2019. That’s 63 million people in the wealthiest country in the world without access to adequate financial services. The rest of the world is even more underbanked and less financially literate. Unbanked– Not having or never having savings, checking, or another account with a bank. Underbanked– Having inadequate access to financial services and banking facilities. Anyone who is unbanked or underbanked cannot partake in earning interest on deposits, investing in the stock market, paying bills online, purchasing goods or services over the internet, accessing credit, or several other valuable financial activities.

Not wanting to trust a counter-party may sound counter-intuitive, butif there is no counter-party, then there is no counter-party risk.If there are no ethics, there is no misbehavior. It’s a technical philosophy embodied in the code behind decentralized systems, and it’s all possible because of the underlying consensus methods that enable blockchains to operate. Consensusmethodsarealgorithmsthat an incentivized computer network uses to participate in collective transaction verification. The process of how this works varies from method to method. Because ofimmutable,interoperable,capable, andpermissionlessblockchains, DeFi can operate in ways that weren’t possible before. Its ambitions span that of enhancing developed financial markets and building the economic infrastructure for emerging and frontier ones. Among many goals, it seeks to onboard fiat currencies to the burgeoning digital blockchain economies through globally transferable stablecoins. Solana alone has already transferred over $300 trillion worth of value on-chain at the time of writing. This would be a huge first step for emerging and frontier economies that deal with volatile domestic currencies and interest rates.

While blockchain detractors claim it’s a solution looking for a problem, blockchain proponents understand that blockchains can address many real-world use cases that cannot be or have not been handled with incumbent systems. DeFi, unlike Bitcoin, is not an argument for a new reserve currency. It’s an argument for a new form of digital commerce."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Consensus Methods", "input": "Consensus Methods", "output": "Consensus methods enable networks to decentralize. These methods are algorithms embedded into the code that allows verified networks of computers to participate in blockchain transactions. They are the absolute cornerstone of every blockchain, and they incentivizeminersorvalidatorsto verify transactions while at the same time making it too expensive to take control of the entire network. If one miner or validator overtakes the network, they could re-write history and front-run any transaction. Generally, the more computers there are mining or validating blocks of transactions, the more secure the network is. There are dozens of consensus methods with which blockchains verify and settle transactions, each with its own tradeoffs. Blockchains have attributes that, when addressed, make other attributes problematic. Ethereum’s co-founder,Vitalik Buterin, has clarified this concept with the idea of theBlockchain Trilemma. It is a set of three issues –decentralization,security, andscalability– which require sacrifices of one for the sake of the others. There are plenty of arguments over which is the most secure consensus method. Still, it’s important to remember that crypto is a hyper-evolving technology that, in many cases, can be considered unproven. There are proven aspects of the technology, but that doesn’t mean another technology can’t come in and make it all obsolete. Some skeptics even think quantum computing will make the cryptography behind cryptocurrency obsolete, but that is entirely hypothetical. The alternate take is that the security measures behind it evolve alongside advances in technologies like quantum computing."}

We’ll break down each of these below. Most chains utilize Proof of Stake to some capacity, although many operate with variations or hybrids of the above. To make it even more confusing, Ethereum is switching from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS), and Solana is a hybrid of PoS and PoW. Ultimately, the vision is for blockchains to operate as an enhanced version of the internet. You won’t need to understand what consensus method is going on behind the scenes of your favorite NFT or DeFi protocol in the same way that you don’t need to understand theTCP/IPandHTTPprotocols behind the scenes of every website on the internet."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Consensus Methods", "input": "Proof of Work (PoW)", "output": "When using a Proof of Work consensus method,the computers that verify transactions must compute highly complex math problems. These computers are calledMiners. Transactions are recorded in a sequential series of blocks that are constantly updated as more transactions are mined. This method prevents users from double spending the same cryptocurrency as every miner can see every transaction made up to the present moment. Mining is an energy-intensive process that requires more energy the more miners are involved. The math problems these miners have to solve become more complex as more miners join the network – thus requiring more energy to be expended. The same is true in the opposite direction. When a Miner has mined a block of transactions (verified them as being true and distributed that truth across the entire miner network), they are rewarded with a token. In the case of the Bitcoin blockchain, miners are rewarded with Bitcoin. The reward size decreases over time, thus introducing more scarcity into the network. An entire overhaul of Bitcoin’s source code would need to be implemented for the total number of Bitcoins to change. Many checks and balances are intended to make changing the code a challenging and arduous process, which would require thousands of developers to agree on issues that have caused previous developers to go out and start their own blockchains. It’s unlikely, but it is possible. The culture surrounding Bitcoin is another roadblock, as Bitcoiners are typically against implementing changes to the protocol. The last of the 21 million Bitcoin is projected to be mined around 2140.It’s up to speculators to estimate how the network will work after all the coins have been excavated – some claim it will be done solely with transaction fees being rewarded to miners. We’ll see (or our grandkids will)."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Consensus Methods", "input": "Hashrate", "output": "The difficulty of the math problems is calculated by Bitcoin’shashrate. The hashrate measures the combined computational power being used to mine Bitcoin. In 2019, China accounted for over 75% of the global hashrate. This meant roughly 75% of Bitcoin mining was taking place in China. In 2021, China banned the holding and mining of cryptocurrencies, and all the Chinese miners were forced to shut down or move operations to a different country. Because of this dramatic event, the hashrate declined. As shown in the diagram above, the hashrate has since improved and reached all-time highs. Many miners moved to the US, which has positioned the US as one of the top locations for Bitcoin miners in the world. It needs to be clarified if this was anticipated by the Chinese government or was an unintended consequence. This hashrate rally occurred during a multi-month drawdown on Bitcoin’s price, so it is clearly not a representation of pricing but rather a representation of the network’s security."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Consensus Methods", "input": "Proof of Stake (PoS)", "output": "Ethereum and Solana utilizeProof of Stake, although Solana is technically a hybrid Proof of Stake andProof of History(PoH) network. The computers verifying transactions on a Proof of Stake network are calledvalidators. These validators are not performing the complicated math to earn rewards but instead proving themselves as network participants with largestakesin the network. Individual stakers choose todelegatetokens to a validator on the network of that token and are rewarded with a share of the validator’s rewards. Stakers delegate to validators based on criteria like their reward share, uptime, and reputation. If you’re staking SOL, you’re doing so through a SOL validator and helping secure the Solana network. 💡 The more validators or miners involved in a blockchain, the better. If a validator has too much sway on the network, they can change the ledger’s history and cause mayhem. To help prevent that from happening on Solana, Solflare has implemented Marinade Finance’s liquid staking product, which delegates SOL to a network of over 450 validators, effectively securing the decentralization of the Solana network. Given that Solflare has facilitated over 25% of SOL staking (roughly $30 billion worth at its peak), this partnership with Marinade is rather significant. Bitcoin is the primary blockchain that utilizes PoW and is somewhat its own. Most of the other top blockchains use PoS or variations of it."}

Proof of History is a mechanism that enables Solana validators to measure time in a new way, allowing them to process transactions at unprecedented speeds. The speed and efficiency of Solana can not be overstated. Proof of History implements a clock that allows validators and the network to tell time without relying on any trusted source. The clock does not measure absolute time frames as a regular atomic clock but rather the relative distance between events and transactions. This enables a standardization that is impossible elsewhere and allows the network to validate information exceptionally quickly.

{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Consensus Methods", "input": "Transaction Speed & Throughput", "output": "Throughput refers to how many actions are completed in a window of time. Different blockchains form for different reasons and have vastly different speeds and throughputs. Bitcoin was formed to be a peer-to-peer method of exchange but has since become digital gold. Ethereum was formed to be aninfinite machine. Solana was developed to be the fastest and most scalable medium to recordstate changes. Bitcoin can handle anywhere from 5-10 transactions per second (tps). Ethereum can handle about 10-30 depending on network congestion, but as many of you know – it can be pretty costly. Solana, on the other hand, can handle roughly 65,000 tps, which will theoretically increase as computing power increases. It regularly handles between 2,000-6,000 tps at the time of writing. Fees are also a fraction of a penny on Solana, while Ethereum fees can range from $5-200 for simple transactions. For some perspective, Visa and Mastercard – centralized entities with closed ecosystems – can handle about 50,000 transactions per second at their peak volumes and charge vendors anywhere from 1-4% per transaction. This isn’t even accounting for exchange fees when a charge is being made outside the country from which the card came. That is all well and good for Visa and Mastercard, but Solana can do the same while being anInteroperableandImmutable open systemwith far lower fees. It’s an upgrade to traditional payment rails."}

Some are built for modularity, and some are made to be monolithic. As mentioned in the first few paragraphs of this chapter, blockchains and cryptocurrencies are hyper-evolving experiments. The goals and vision of blockchains differ as much as the technology does, and there are endless arguments on the validity and security of different consensus methods. As a result,new blockchains are popping up every year. Much of this course includes topics that could be a course in itself. Consensus methods could bemanycourses. It’s a vast topic relevant to developers, entrepreneurs, and investors alike. If you want to invest in or build something on a blockchain, you need to know what’s possible – andconsensus methods make it all possible."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: NFTs & DAOs", "input": "NFTs", "output": "An NFT is a non-fungible token worth some amount of (a) fungible token(s).NFTs are complicated, wide-ranging, and severely misunderstood regarding their potential. They’re traded on-chain, so NFT markets are open 24/7. While most of what you regard as an NFT will likely be worthless in due time, there can be massive amounts of inherent value when designed with utility in mind. NFTs can represent both digital and real-life objects. Owning an NFT worth $10,000 can be much more powerful than holding $10,000, but it is not easy to explain why if you need help understanding how blockchains work. NFTs can represent basically anything, such as the ownership of areal-world asset,music royalties,socks,art,in-game items, and evensophisticated DeFi mechanisms. Anyone with an NFT can be airdropped future tokens and NFTs. NFTs can give you special access to a concert or any live event. They can be static profile photos, they can be generative gifs, and they can even be the deed to your house. The opportunities are virtually and physically limitless. Think of the NFTs you own as the digital version of your belongings on display in your house. Art on the walls, a collection of your favorite artists’ CDs, posters of memorable past events, etc. Instead of this collection of belongings’ visibility being limited to visitors in your home, anyone can view your digital NFT gallery to get a sense of your interests, hobbies, and cherished items. LikeVincent Van Dough’smulti-million dollar virtual studio below, you can also make customized 3D and VR-accessible museums for your collections."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: NFTs & DAOs", "input": "Symbiosis", "output": "When an investor buys an NFT, the NFT is automatically deposited into their wallet, and depending on the exchange, the funds should be automatically deposited into a creator’s wallet. The investor is buying the NFT because they see value in holding it. This permission-less value transfer from creators to investors is not one way. Creators get to set a royalty rate on their NFTs, which often ranges from 1-5%. If the rate were 5%, then the NFT creator would automatically receive 5% of every secondary sale. No ifs, and, or buts. The code behind the autonomous smart contracts involved is in charge. It’s a bit different than Apple’s 30% take rate on every sale of anything within the app store. This capability was impossible a decade ago, and it is a game-changer for creator economies like video games, digital art, music, and film. Think about the ramifications for an incumbent industry withanyform of cash flow. Royalties generated from an NFT project can be funneled into a community treasury governed by a DAO of people who own the NFTs from said project. How do you gain access to the DAO? Own an NFT from the project."}

In short, it is a mentality and framework for how the internet should evolve. A full description of web 3 is out of the scope of this course but feel free to check out the articles breaking downWeb 1,Web 2, andWeb 3on Solflare’s Knowledge Base. Many conventional web 2 creators and engineers have a significant amount of vitriol for what’s being called web 3. Web 3 has become quite thebuzzword, althoughit’s simply a function and philosophy for how the open internet should operate. It’s closer to the vision that early internet developers had when compared to what the internet has turned out to be – a few walled gardens full of user-generated content.Web 3’s ideal framework is user-owned networks. Regarding the creator economy, the new multi-chain toolset that is beginning to enable user-owned networks issurreallyunderrated in the mainstream. Sure, you can make a2+ hour-long YouTube videodescribing what you think is wrong with how people choose to use NFTs,oryou canembrace the new toolset, foster a hybrid community of fans and investors around you, and generate a hybrid assembly of fans and investors peer-to-peer income streams that have never existed before. There’s an expanding list of platforms facilitating this newfound value creation; some of the best areMirror,Sound,Catalog,Glass,Pianity,Audius,Nina, and all the high-quality NFT exchanges out there. Alsoloft.radio. If someone is talking down on NFTs, they probably don’t understand them. If you’re still skeptical, contact any artist on any of the platforms listed above and have them compare their Web 3 experience to their Web 2 experience."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: NFTs & DAOs", "input": "Inherent Value", "output": "NFTs are not only subject to creator economies. They can operate in any industry. Imagine an NFT framework for a residential investment property, an ice cream store, or a Bruno Mars song. Any cash flow can be tokenized, fractionalized, and distributed via NFTs.It’s similar to horse syndication in professional horse racing, but it can be applied to nearly any asset class. NFTs are poised to flip the creator economy on its head by giving individuals access to innovative community and fundraising opportunities while doing so in this new permission-less world of DeFi, NFTs, and DAOs. Rather than build user-generated content gated behind centralized networks like Twitter or Facebook, Web 3 proponents seek to build user-owned networks that empower individuals and lessen barriers to entry for many industries."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: NFTs & DAOs", "input": "NFT & DeFiMoney Legos", "output": "NFTs can be used as collateral for lending and borrowing, or they can be tools within the complex network of cross-chain DeFi protocols. Think of all these machinations as if they were each different legos. Many DeFi developers refer to what they do as buildingmoney legoswhich may help you visualize how it works. Alongside using them as collateral, NFTs themselves can be fractionalized. Fractionalized.iois an exchange where users can choose how much of an NFT they want to sell and for what price. The impact fractionalization has on NFT-gated DAOs is determinable on a case-by-case basis. Just for fun There is even a project where a photo of the Shiba Inu dog was turned into an NFT, fractionalized, and used as collateral backing a new cryptocurrency:DOG. OK, now on to DAOs."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: NFTs & DAOs", "input": "DAOs", "output": "DAOs have been around for quite some time. They stand forDecentralized Autonomous Organizationsand are a de facto standard for how many crypto protocols operate. The first DAO references began popping up in the early 90s, although they only became a reality in the mid-2010s. In the early days of Bitcoin, crypto enthusiasts would attempt to build proto-DAOs called DACs – Decentralized Autonomous Corporations. These DACs slowly evaporated as there was no sustainable platform for them to operate on in the way the enthusiasts envisioned. Once Ethereum was live, DAOs emerged.The early formations of DACs and DAOs strongly believed that code is the law. Although that sentiment has since diminished because of the abundantly clear fact thatcode is fallible, the belief still permeates through operational procedures within DAOs asmost activity occurs on-chain or through a series of smart contracts. Above is a screenshot of DeepDAO’s analytical dashboard breaking down recent DAO statistics. With over 4,000 organizations, $10 billion across treasuries, and 1.8 million unique governance token holders, DAOs look like they’re here to stay."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: NFTs & DAOs", "input": "Case Study", "output": "If you transact on Uniswap, Ethereum’s largest DEX, you pay the transaction fee in ETH. So what’s the UNI token for? The short answer is governance. The Uniswap protocol earns fees automatically deposited into a treasury which is then governed by UNI holders via components of the smart contracts involved. There are no intermediaries escrowing funds or charging excessive fees.It is simply people interacting with a decentralized protocol on a decentralized blockchain.Recently, Uniswap’s trading volume eclipsed that of Coinbase. Due to smart contract programming, a portion of all the transaction fees is automatically deposited into the Uniswap Treasury wallet. This treasury now holds over $2,600,000,000 at current prices. Who decides what is done with this money? UNI holders. UNI holders vote on proposals for what is done with the treasury. 1 UNI = 1 vote. There are issues with this model, such as the idea that a rich person or company could come in and buy all the tokens to domineer governance decisions. Many alternative models are constantly being iterated on, so if you don’t like the DAO you’re in, join another one."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: NFTs & DAOs", "input": "Effectiveness", "output": "On-chain governance is a field that has really taken off in the past few years. You’ll see the letters D A O imprinted all over the place, and sometimes it makes more sense than others. The effectiveness of DAOs is up for debate on the whole. However, there are numerous examples of successful implementations and people making a living in the pseudonymous economy by contributing to one or more DAOs from ananonaccount. Ananonymous account is technically a pseudonymous account where someone communicates with the DAO as an unknown entity."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: NFTs & DAOs", "input": "Legal Ramifications", "output": "Legal ramifications also need to be considered, especially when a DAO is built around investing – such as a decentralized venture capital firm,StackerVentures. This field of law is highly murky, and pioneers are still figuring out how things will work. The US state of Wyoming has institutedDAOsas a variation of the traditional LLC framework that companies follow, but it is still early in the game. If you’re a lawyer, you should learn about crypto. Thank me later."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: NFTs & DAOs", "input": "Lessening Barriers to Digital Democracy", "output": "The long-term purposes of DAOs are to decrease the amount of control an entity has within an organization. It’s a natural extension of Democracy, but its effectiveness varies from DAO to DAO. Forming an online community (DAO) and building a treasury (coins, tokens, NFTs) that the community can govern has always been challenging. This has resulted in many spectacular projects across the world."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: NFTs & DAOs", "input": "The Skeuomorphic Argument", "output": "Skeuomorphism refers to the idea of doing something that is obsolete but in a new context. It has been used at great length to discuss issues with DeFi and Web3. Token-based governance is a reasonably skeuomorphic concept because TradFi systems already enable corporate governance via share ownership. The difference that DAOs offer is these tokens exist on-chain in an inherently composable and transparent nature compared to TradFi, where equity shares have many inhibiting features, and significant decisions are made behind closed doors. This concept of composability means that these tokens can be utilized in many shapes and sizes, such as a form of voting rights in a DAO or collateral in a DeFi project. Some votes are worth more than others, and token-gated DAOs constantly evolve. You can even send on-chain bribes. Say you wanted to influence the decision of a UNI whale. Well, you could send over some ETH or USDC and try to convince them. This opens a discussion of tokenomics that we won’t get into here but know that a lot is going on out there. The topic of composability has become the backbone of much of the DeFi, NFT, and DAO worlds."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: NFTs & DAOs", "input": "Finally", "output": "As you can see,there really is a crypto renaissance happening.

It’s hard to imagine an industry that is exempt from what is happening in crypto. Just remember: Congratulations, you now have a fundamental understanding of how it all works. 🥂 Check out the last chapter, a glossary of all the concepts we covered, and some further readinglinks."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Self Custody: Part 1", "input": "Today’s Agenda", "output": "In the last chapter, we discussed how blockchains operate behind the scenes using consensus methods. Today, we’re going to zoom in on the individual users of blockchains and dig into some of what’s possible. To start, let’s focus on non-custodial wallets."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Self Custody: Part 1", "input": "What is a Non-Custodial Wallet?", "output": "Non-custodial wallets are digital wallets that give you only access to what’s in them. They are like private bank accounts built on a blockchain, consisting of 3 primary mechanisms –public keys,private keys, andmnemonics. You can connect to crypto applications likeSolriseandMagic Edenwith your wallet; no intermediary is ever between you and your assets. You’re in complete control."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Self Custody: Part 1", "input": "Benefits of Non-Custodial Wallets", "output": "The short answer: Traditional custodial methods for asset management always require at least one counterparty, like a bank. A non-custodial wallet enables you to custody your assets withoutanycounterparty. The long answer: Decentralized networks only make sense if the assets on them are also decentralized. If blockchains operated in a decentralized fashion while wallets operated using centralized counterparties, all the benefits of the blockchain would vanish, and the same problems in centralized finance would exist in decentralized finance."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Self Custody: Part 1", "input": "Real-World Use Case", "output": "Non-custodial wallets are ground-breaking and enable digital economies to exist in ways unlike ever before. Their significance can be difficult to convey, so let’s start with a tangible real-world example. When migrant workers acquire a visa to work in foreign countries and send back money to their families back home, they send what’s called aremittance. This is usually done throughWestern Unionor some large bank that has branches all over the world. Low-income country remittances amounted to $466 billion in 2017. Globally, fees averaged 7.45%, or $34.7 billion. $7.45% equates to over 27 days of an average worker’s annual income, meaning low-incomemigrantworkers spent 27 days’ worth of their 2017 salary to send money back home. To put the absolute dollar value of these fees into perspective, the US’s non-military foreign aid budget in 2017 was$34 billion. Non-custodial wallets present an alternative solution by enabling permissionless, global capital transfers.If blockchains or blockchain wallets werecustodial, the counterparty could stop transactions from happening and require all remittances to be paid throughWestern Union. Foreign workers are already taking advantage of the low-cost and open nature of cryptocurrencies, and it’s one of the most influential and socially impactful use cases for the technology we’ve seen to date."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Self Custody: Part 1", "input": "It’s complicated", "output": "Non-custodial wallets are made possible by public and private key cryptography, which is particularly complex. Like using the internet today, you won’t need to understand what’s happening under the hood to securely custody your assets. You’ll need to understand the basics –public, private, andmnemonics. Let’s start with public keys."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Self Custody: Part 1", "input": "Public Keys", "output": "Public keys are wallet addresses. Think of them as your email address. You can send emails to any email address at any time. In the same way, you can send digital assets to any wallet’s address at any time – as long as the blockchain you’re on is not compromised. Public keys are intimidating if you’re new to them, but you can copy and paste them when necessary. This one-time copy and pasting are recommended in crypto, as copying and pasting a private key or mnemonic can result in a hacker obtaining it. There are several operational security practices you’ll have to undertake to properly self custody your assets. Each character of thewallet address / public keyis connected to your private key, and if you send digital assets to the wrong wallet address, you will likely be unable to recover them. This issue is continually being addressed by wallet designers. If these long alphanumerics are overly intimidating, there’s always the option to utilize acustodial walletat a centralized crypto exchange (likeFTXorCoinbase) rather than a non-custodial one (likeSolflareorMetamask). Many wallets have built-in address books, so you won’t need to copy and paste a public key every time. Most mainstream crypto exchanges also support this feature. The risk of utilizing a non-custodial wallet is either losing your private key, mnemonic/recovery phraseor stealing it.Keeping a copy of each of those written down and stored safely is crucial.Some people etch it into fireproof, “bullet-proof” steel. Only take a video for social media and accidentally leave your phrase visible in the background. Don’t click on any suspicious-looking links – they could bephishing attemptsthat could drain your wallet. This happened toSeth Green, who played Dr. Evil in the movie trilogy Austin Powers. Also,don’t take screenshots of your recovery phrase or private key. Your photos are likely automatically uploaded to iCloud or Google Photos and are subject to risk and seizure by your cloud computing service or federal authorities."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Self Custody: Part 1", "input": "Private Keys", "output": "Private keysare a bit harder to describe than public ones. A private key is an alphanumeric string of characters that gives you access to your wallet. Think of a private key as a randomly generated password for a specific account that you access with a master password technology likeNordPassorLast Pass. The master password, in this case, would be your mnemonic phrase. You won’t need to remember your private key and will likely never need to use it. It is, however, a vitally important string of characters.Access to your private key (via your recovery phrase) is necessary to access your funds."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Self Custody: Part 1", "input": "Mnemonics / Recovery Phrases / Seed Phrases", "output": "A private key allows you to sign transactions for a single wallet account.Recovery phrases, however, give you access to an infinite number of private keys. New wallets can be added to one mnemonic’s purview by being imported or generated within the intended wallet’s user interface. Mnemonics serve two primary purposes: Check out this article to learn about the different types of wallets crypto users utilize. In short, your mnemonic gives you access to your private key, which provides you with access to your funds. From the user’s perspective,Mnemonics / Recovery Phrases / Seed Phrasesare the most essential aspect of a wallet. They are the human-readable sequences of words that give you access to your private keys and, thus, your capital. The words are generally in English, although there are many languages wallet providers can choose to implement. A public key can easily be calculated from a private key; however, computing the private key from a public key is impossible. Most people are blissfully unaware of their private key(s), which is fine … as long as they arepainfully awareof their mnemonic. To be clear, a mnemonic isnota private key, although if someone were to obtain either your mnemonicoryour private key, your digital assets would be compromised. As mentioned above, think of your mnemonic as the master password to a password management system. All the passwords you are storing in the system would be your private keys in this analogy. Some wallets also utilize an existing password. Passwords are not that big of a deal. They are primarily there for convenience, so you don’t have to input your mnemonic phrase whenever you want to access your funds. If you forget your password, you can just reset it with your mnemonic phrase. No email, phone, or 2-factor authentication methods are required!"}

As you can see, these topics are conceptually nottoocomplex, and all you need to know is the tip of the iceberg.The entire iceberg is what they call the rabbit hole. Crypto’s adoption and accessibility metrics are similar to the early internet. Initially, things were overly complicated for the average individual, and generalists ruled the land. To use the internet, you had to know what you were doing. In today’s modern internet, youbarelyneed to see what you are doing. The barriers to entry have dropped dramatically, and specialists are now in charge. Although the internet had massive technical learning curves at first, once protocols (likeHTTPandTCP/IPmentioned earlier in the course) were standardized and the average adult understood how to operate it, it took over. If you stick through with this course, you can count yourself a pioneer in blockchain technology. You’ll be right there with it as it continues to take over. Ethereum has ~500,000 daily users. Every other blockchain has far less. Twitter has ~200,000,000 daily users. Facebook has ~2,000,000,000 daily users. We’re so early. 🤝"}

From 1907 to 1910, severe public panics led to bank runs.Bank runsoccur when more people want to withdraw from a bank than a bank can handle. The possibility of this event results fromfractional reserve lending, which enables banks to only hold a portion of your deposit on hand. At the same time, they lend the rest out to other customers. In 1910, after helping bail out a particularly bad bank run, Chase Bank’s founder,J.P Morgan, and other high-ranking bankers secretly secluded themselves for 10 days to figure out how they could enhance the American banking system. This plan came to fruition 3 years later in the form of the Federal Reserve, a singular central bank for the USA. The FED can be considered a hybrid or different faction within the US government. It’s part of the US governmental purview, but it doesn’tnecessarilyhave to listen to congress. Congress enactsfiscalpolicy, such as raising and loweringtaxrates, while central banks, like the FED, enactmonetarypolicy, such as raising and loweringinterestrates. The two are often in cahoots. As the US gained a larger share of global dominance after the two World Wars, the FED’s macroeconomic role only gained prominence. Since the chart-breaking inflation metrics of the 1970s, the FED has generally enacted anexpansionarymonetary policy (in contrast to acontractionaryone) in the form of lowering interest rates. Think about interest rates as the cost of borrowing money. Dropping them effectively lets individuals and businesses take more risks. As interest rates have declined, even to the negative in many parts of the world, asset prices have skyrocketed. This is because businesses can borrow more money, invest in more projects, and say their future value will be even higher. For more context, stock markets are valued onfuturecash flows.

{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: A Bird’s Eye View", "input": "DeFi Doubters", "output": "F. Scott Fitzgerald There are generally 2 types of DeFi doubters: A more thoughtful approach to crypto and DeFi is to beskeptically optimistic. With any new technology, there will be disruption, and not all of it will always be good. The primary problem in blockchain-related technology is that most people need help understanding it. It’s easy to get scammed when you don’t know what you’re doing, and it’s easy to trust a snake oil salesperson if you think they know what they’re talking about. As is the case with the medical and scientific fields, it doesn’t take a lot of knowledge in crypto to sound like you know what you’re talking about. Until the average user learns what they need to know or until crypto applications’ UI/UX flows reinforce all they need to know in their users’ mindsets, crypto will remain a wild west to the uninformed. While it’s better to be an optimistic skeptic, it’s all well and good to be a DeFi Doubter, but what’s the alternative? A continuation of opaque market procedures, unsustainable monetary policy, and hyper-inflationary events of debased fiat currencies becoming the norm? The world is trending in a populist, deglobalizing direction, likely bringing about continued fiscal and monetary looseness. The plan is to tame inflation (9.1%in the US as of June 2022) by increasing interest rates over the next few years. As an asset class, Crypto has never experienced a prolonged environment of rising interest rates, so it will be interesting to see how prices react. However, there is a solid case to be made that interest rates will stay elevated for a while. Below is a chart of the last 700 years of interest rates across the globe. As the US proceeds to decouple itself from its previous role of international protector and, in some cases – aggressor in exchange for a more isolationist position, free global trade will struggle to sustain the exponential growth it’s experienced over the past 50-70 years. Alongside broken supply chains, uprising political conflicts, and currency debasements, politicians and central bankers will have no choice but to enact a populist fiscal policy (low taxes & high spending) and a liberal monetary policy (low-interest rates & potentially quantitative easing &yield curve control). All of this means that fiat money will continue to devalue over time. For now, USD is accruing more value as the world outside of the US struggles to find or create worthy alternatives, but is that sustainable? The chart below shows how much the value of $1 has declined from 1913 to 2013. TL;DRIn today’s terms, $1 in 1900 was equivalent to $26.14 in 2020, implying a decrease in buying power of 96.2%. Remember, when assets go down 90+% in value, that never means they can’t do the same thing again. So, where does DeFi come in? It varies. If you’re in one of the wealthier countries in the world, you may utilize DeFi as an alternative investment class. Still, for those in less financially secure countries, you may be using DeFi because you don’t have any other option."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: A Bird’s Eye View", "input": "DeFi’s Use Cases Today", "output": "Let’s say you’re living in Turkey. The Turkish Lira experienced a reported 78% inflation from 2021-2022. So your $100 worth of TRL is roughly $22 if the bank gives you back your deposit. This type of heartache used to be unavoidable for the global middle and lower classes, but now there’s an alternative. Instead of using a soon-to-be-defunct domestic bank in a country with a falling currency, you can open a non-custodial wallet like Solflare and securely store an infinite amount of digital assets. This wallet isn’t physical. You can bring it across borders by remembering your recovery phrase or keeping a copy of your private key. Operational security risks and other nuances need to be considered, but this example gives you an idea of what’s possible. How easy is it to withdraw $25,000 from your bank? How easy is it to travel across violent borders with that $25,000 – especially if that $25,000 worth of value is in another currency other than the USD. The answers are all that it is exceedingly difficult to do so without DeFi. Real estate debt levels and nationalized industry have taken a toll on the Chinese banking system, and some banks have already censored withdrawals. Chinese authorities recently switched some citizen health codes fromCovid negative to positive(which effectively banned them from all public venues and transport systems) to prevent them from withdrawing from their bank. In May of 2022, it was reported that nearly1 millionChinese customers were unable to withdraw money from bank accounts. Thentanks were deployedon the protesters who had their funds frozen. Regarding centralization and censorship, China is extreme, but the world operates on a spectrum. The need for DeFi also operates on that spectrum. Crypto has been iterating on its forms of yield generation for some time. Some of it is a positive byproduct of the tools used within DeFi, and some of the more centralized versions of it, likeCelsius, are nothing but loosely regulated, falsely marketed, over-leveraged degeneracy. Using liquidity pools is one example of genuine yield generation that cuts out the middle man and gives regular people a chance to profit from their digital assets. For a complete primer on them, check out the article below. Traditional financial markets require market makers. Market makers are specialized traders who provide liquidity to a market. There are good and bad effects, side effects, and second-order effects resulting from this infrastructure, and one of the outcomes is the vast majority of traders lose money. Through the use of precise algorithms,Automated Market Makers(AMMs) effectively replace market makers for both volatile assets (ETH for BTC or ETH for USD) and stable assets (USDC for USDT or ETH for wETH). As described in Chapter 3, AMMs are algorithms programmed atop a blockchain that let you trade one digital asset for another using a pool of funds and a pricing mechanism. Liquidity providers are usually paid in one of two ways – with a share of the trading fees or an incentivized liquidity allocation. Incentivized liquidity allocations (liquidity mining campaigns) are unsustainable but extending a percentage of trading fees to liquidity providers is not. Below is a list of the top 57-Day Average Feesmetrics DEXes across various blockchains. The fee model for nearly all these DEXes is a variation of “Trading fees are paid by traders to liquidity providers.” This is a prime example of democratized access to a yield that was gaited and exclusively available to market makers in a TradFi framework. Utilizing AMMs also makes financial services more transparent as the entire convolutedtrade life cycleis simplified as it’s all settled on a public blockchain. No morepayment for order flow! Ryan Selkis, the CEO ofMessari, recently published a thread of “35” use cases for which you can use DeFi. It’s worth a scroll."}

The full scope of CBDCs and their impact likely will be understood once their widespread adoption has taken effect.

Most crypto users keep their funds on exchanges, which means accountability is transferred to the exchange.Financial contagions begin when large custodians of volatile assets become insolvent.Accounts on Coinbase, for example, are subject to seizure if Coinbase becomes insolvent. In other words, if Coinbase goes bankrupt –the banks will take the money (crypto) in your account to cover their debts.

This signature is publicly indexable through various blockchain explorers likeSolscanorEtherscan.For every blockchain transaction, documentation of the public keys involved, the transactionhash, the transaction fee paid, and other tidbits of relevant information exist. Think of each of your public keys as an extension of your digital identity. This public information can be analyzed retrospectively to see where and how the current balances came to be.

Prices were rising at unsustainable rates, and some protocols were failing while their tokens were going to zero. DeFi protocols like the ones listed above – with some staying power – have inspired thousands of blockchain applications to be built across dozens of blockchains. There is a group of financial services that DeFi protocols inhabit that are mirrored on one new blockchain after the next.They have become the standard stack.Without the basic DeFi layer, blockchains are considered to be lacking.

Here’s the unabridged process for funding an account on a CEX. The above processes do not even consider the number of centralized entities involved. The centralized exchange has a centralized custodian who possesses all of the stocks and options that people own. The centralized market makers have a much more in-depth understanding of current market conditions because they are privy to every single order. Etc. Market makers are known to play games. Below is an example of that. The market maker sells you the 100 shares but not before buying 10 puts that represent a 10x exposure of being short to your 1x exposure of being long (a put = exposure to 100 shares of being short Apple). FYI, if they sell you 100 shares of Apple, they are technically short 100 shares, and buying 10 puts makes them long 900 shares. The centralized exchanges often sell order flowin a business model called payment for order flow –PFOF, to market makers in exchange for the market makers to make markets. This is counterintuitive as it makes the information asymmetry already present in finance that much more dramatic. PFOF is the reason you can trade without commissions. As is the case across much of the traditional internet,if you use a free product – it’s actuallyyouwho is the product.

Bitcoin, for example, increased in value by 6,965,454,545.45% between 2010 and 2021. Its low was $0.00099, and the all-time high was $$68,958."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Blockchain Foundations", "input": "Uncertainty", "output": "Financial markets serve many critical economic functions, although they do not always reflect what’s happening in the real world. They often aren’t. The stock market, for example, is constantly attempting to base prices and valuations on future expectations. To predict future outcomes, you want the least amount of uncertainty involved. Markets crave certainty. When outcomes are uncertain – such as when a supply chain crisis, a war, or a pandemic occurs- prices will reflect that. Speculative assets like revenueless tech stocks or purposeless altcoins will reflect uncertainty by having their price spike downwards because there is no more perceived value.Re-pricings will occur, even if it’s not immediate. It’s easy to forget that asset prices can go down another 99% after dropping by 99%."}

As one of the oldest forms of human currency, Gold has become what is referred to as a safe haven asset. It’s important to understand that money flows from speculative investments to safe-haven assets isn’t happening automatically. It’s a result of trader psychology being influenced bymimetic desire, and it happens slowly, then all at once (similar to how risk works – stairway up, elevator down). Mimetic desireis best explained with an analogy. Imagine you are standing next to someone on a trampoline. That person sees something they want that requires them to jump to reach it. When they jump, you feel the movement of the trampoline underneath you. A natural reaction is to look at where this movement is coming from. When you see what the person next to you wants,Mimetictheoryargues that you’ll also start to want that thing. Learn more about ithere. Other than its use in jewelry,Goldis perceived to exist outside of the traditional financial system, althoughbanks are the largest owners of it, and derivatives are constantly used to manipulate its price –so that is a relatively naïve assumption. Below is one of the many headlines detailingbig bank baboonery. In this instance, JPM Chase had to pay a $920 million fine. They’ll survive. Even though Gold has performed well in the past during times of distress, this rise in value is not based on any fundamental, intrinsic characteristic. Gold is not easy to transport or store, especially at scale.Try moving $1 billion in Gold across an ocean.Due to big players in the industry, Gold is actually a very centralized commodity, and the price will only appreciate because of a fluctuatingextrinsicvalue. Someone will see that someone else has Gold, and they’ll want it. What if everyone thought silver was a better store of value, or tungsten, or rhodium, or zinc… or Bitcoin?"}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Blockchain Foundations", "input": "Bitcoin as Digital Gold", "output": "Narratives drive markets as much or more than fear and uncertainty do. Although Gold hasn’t been a practical currency in hundreds if not thousands of years in most places, it’s still being recommended by big banks and asset managers as a safe haven asset worthy of 1-5% of a traditional financial nest egg in the off-chance that calamity happens. This narrative that it stores its value in times of distress is just that – a narrative. It will work until it doesn’t. If rarity or scarcity is the argument, there are more scarce assets on this planet that could replace Gold if the narrative shifted. Bitcoin is one of them. As proposed in the white paper, Bitcoin was initially conceived as apeer-to-peer method of exchange. It has since become part of the larger store of value narrative that Gold can attribute its declining relevance to, except this time – it’s digital. Bitcoin has been referred to asDigital Goldby many investors and mainstream media pundits, partially because that’s the most digestible explanation they can come up with and partially because it’s true. It’s not the whole story behind what, how, and why Bitcoin came to be, but it’s agoodand strong story. Traditional investors can now fathom investing 1-5% of their portfolio into Bitcoin, and more progressive investors have a new lens to view markets with. The idea of existing outside the traditional financial system will be an important one to touch on again when we start coveringDeFi(Decentralized Finance) later in this course."}

The goal is for anyone to build and use them. There are no credit checks and the only requirement to open a digital wallet is to have an internet connection. The reality of censorship resistance in crypto is that some blockchains do a better job than others.The blockchain industry is barely a teenager,and there are many schools of thought regarding how it should operate. Maximalism, tribalism, and investor bias all contribute to a never-ending conversation on which consensus methods and blockchain infrastructure are the most secure and most censorship-resistant."}

Understand the tech and then form an opinion. That’s enough for today. If you’re inexperienced in this world, these concepts can seem quite complicated and full of jargon at first, so it’s best to learn them in continuous and small doses – with the occasional obsessive deep dive."}
