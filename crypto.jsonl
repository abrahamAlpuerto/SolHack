{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "What is Bitcoin?", "output": "Bitcoin is a decentralized digital asset. It was invented in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto, an anonymous developer, as a response to the traditional financial system bailing out failed banks. The idea was to create a new form of money, or “peer-to-peer electronic cash system,” fully owned by its participants and outside the control of centralized entities, such as governments and banks. To pull this off, Satoshi developed (1) bitcoin, the currency and (2) Bitcoin, the network. Bitcoin, the currency (denominated as BTC) is a decentralized cryptocurrency (or digital asset) with a capped supply of 21 million (of which ~19 million have already been mined). As mentioned above, BTC was invented to be a form of money, but now it acts more as a store of value. Like gold. Due to its scarcity, bitcoin can protect your purchasing power and hedge against inflation. However, unlike gold, bitcoin is hard to confiscate and easy to “transport” and transfer. This is due to Bitcoin, the network. Bitcoin, the network, is a peer-to-peer (P2P) network of computers (and the people behind them) that run the Bitcoin protocol (the set of rules for sending and receiving bitcoin). This network maintains the public, decentralized database (the Bitcoin blockchain) that tracks the creation, ownership, and transfer of bitcoin, the currency. To ensure that the database is accurate, the computers verify that each update follows the rules of the Bitcoin protocol. If it doesn’t, it’s ignored. If all computers agree, it’s accepted. This happens through a process called proof-of-work (PoW). Proof-of-Work (PoW) is Bitcoin’s consensus mechanism. It’s what makes Bitcoin possible. Because it doesn’t have a centralized body, Bitcoin relies on its decentralized network of computers to verify transactions. These computers (or “miners”) compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles to verify new data, and the first to solve them earns newly-created bitcoin (in a process known as “mining”). This mining process secures the network, removes the need for a trusted third party, and enables the creation of new bitcoin. Now, let’s sum things up. Through the combination of its virtual currency, decentralized network, public database, and PoW consensus mechanism, Bitcoin developed a new alternative financial system free of centralized authorities and middlemen."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "What can you do on Bitcoin?", "output": "Although Bitcoin was created to be a new form of money, its various network upgrades (SegWit, native SegWit, taproot) have unlocked newer, exciting use cases: Bitcoin non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Bitcoin Name Service (BNS), and more. But before we dive into these newer use cases, let’s cover Bitcoin’s primary purpose—finance."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Decentralized Finance (DeFi)", "output": "Bitcoin is a decentralized financial (DeFi) system. When you buy BTC (and, thus, join the Bitcoin network), you begin to participate in a new form of money. One in which the rules are clear and you own your money. Not governments or banks. This allows you to… Save and invest BTC Unlike fiat currencies—which can be issued at will and lose value over time—bitcoin has a fixed, capped supply. There will only ever be 21 million. And no person, organization, bank, or government can change this. Due to this, some people see bitcoin as a savings vehicle and others see it as an investment. In developing countries, with low economic and political stability, some citizens resort to bitcoin to protect their money from hyper inflation and government oppression. With just their secret phrase (a series of 12-24 words), they can store their money somewhere that can’t be confiscated—in their mind and on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the developed world, Bitcoin is most often treated as an investment. Due to its fixed, capped supply, Bitcoin is scarce. It’s also governed by the law of supply and demand. So, if interest continues to rise, from retail and institutional investors, the price will too. With this in mind, many investors are pouring money into this digital asset to benefit from the expected appreciation and diversify their portfolios."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Ordinals (Bitcoin NFTs)", "output": "Long before Ethereum and Solana became known for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Bitcoin was the site of early NFT history. Projects like Colored Coins and Rare Pepes pioneered the digital art movement and paved the way for future NFT innovation. Although NFT activity on Bitcoin largely cooled down after this, it saw a resurgence in early 2023 with Ordinals, a novel form of NFTs native to the Bitcoin network. This development, by Casey Rodarmor, reinvigorated NFT development on Bitcoin and led to new fun use cases. Here are a few: Buy, sell, and trade NFTs Gone are the days of only HODLing bitcoin. Now, you can engage in NFT-related activities on Bitcoin too. On marketplaces such as Magic Eden, you’ll browse, buy, sell, and trade Bitcoin NFTs.

{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Bitcoin Name Service (BNS)", "output": "Bitcoin Name Service is a decentralized naming database on Bitcoin that supplies simple usernames that end in “.btc.” With these human-readable usernames, you can send and receive bitcoin and ordinals without dealing with long, complicated wallet addresses. Why does this matter? Because it’s faster, easier, and less prone to error. You don’t need to memorize complex wallet addresses or deal with the anxiety of inputting them correctly, character by character. Another cool aspect of BNS is that it’s customizable. Similar to website URLs or social media usernames, you can choose your username. DiamondHandz.btc? PayMeInBitcoin.btc? HODLgod.btc? Whatever name you want, it’s yours—as long as it’s available. This allows you to create and manage your digital identity, and shape how you’ll be perceived on the internet."}

The result is a faster, more efficient financial system that's available to anyone with an internet connection. Solana was built with DeFi in mind. Because of the blockchain’s ability to handle over 65,000 transactions per second (Visa supports 24,000 per second), Solana has attracted developers to create a range of powerful DeFi dApps that you can access right from your Phantom wallet. To get you started, Phantom brings you a fast and easy way to buy SOL, USDC, and USDT in-app. You can directly buy or transfer SOL using MoonPay or Coinbase accounts to your Phantom Wallet. Once you have SOL in your wallet, you can stake your SOL tokens directly from Phantom and earn more SOL in the process. Purchasing, swapping, and staking are three of the core mechanisms of the Solana blockchain and DeFi. Once you feel ready to graduate to more sophisticated applications, these are three powerful DeFi apps worth checking out: Orca Orca is an easy, fast, and user-friendly decentralized exchange on the Solana blockchain. In addition to low-fee, near-instant token swaps using an automated market maker (AMM) model, you're able to participate in the protocol by supplying liquidity (depositing pairs of tokens) to earn yield on token pairs. Mango Markets Mango Markets is another powerful decentralized exchange that allows you to lend, borrow, swap, and trade cryptoassets through a powerful risk engine. You can earn passive interest on deposits and trade both spot and future trading pairs. It's a powerful protocol for the DeFi power user. Solend Solend is a decentralized protocol for lending and borrowing on Solana. With Solend you can earn interest, borrow, leverage long, and short cryptoassets.

{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "What is Ethereum?", "output": "Launched in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, the Ethereum blockchain is a global software platform that allows users to hold virtual currencies, transact with them, and deploy decentralized applications. Ethereum was the first to introduce an innovation called smart contracts that allowed “programmable” money and applications. Smart contracts are digital agreements deployed on the blockchain that automatically execute when pre-defined conditions are met. Let’s understand this with an example — say you’re looking to take a loan from your bank. With a traditional bank, you’ve got to go through credit checks, fill out a bunch of paperwork, and deal with complex repayment terms. But not with DeFi. With DeFi, and smart contracts, you can get a loan anytime from anywhere without the need for approval from a central authority like a bank."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "What is ETH?", "output": "Ether (ETH) is the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain. Every transaction you make on the Ethereum network requires transaction fees as you’re using the network’s resources. These are called gas fees. Gas fees are distributed amongst network participants as rewards for dedicating their computing power to keep the network running. ETH is also used to transfer value between users of the blockchain. For instance, if you provide a service to a company, you can opt to use ETH as a payment method. Once you fulfill the agreement, the company will send you the set amount of ETH to your wallet."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "What are ERC-20 tokens?", "output": "ERC-20 tokens are the standard for creating fungible tokens or “digital currencies” on the Ethereum blockchain. Typically, ERC-20 tokens belong to a decentralized application — applications with smart contracts as their backend. ERC-20 tokens are “currencies” that are individual to each decentralized application and power the app economy for that application.

DEXs became popular due to the shortcomings of custodial centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Binance or Coinbase. CEXs act as a “custodian” or guardian for your crypto assets, similar to banks. However, that also means you are entrusting your money to a third-party — which can restrict or limit your access to your assets in case of problems.

{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Key takeaways:", "output": "Most crypto beginners start by opening an account on a crypto exchange like Coinbase. Although exchanges have become the go-to entry point for newcomers to web3, it's crucial to recognize the inherent risks associated with exchange wallets, as they exercise control over your assets. Opting for self-custody wallets like Phantom presents significant benefits, granting you complete authority over your crypto holdings and enabling seamless access to the vast landscape of web3 applications. In this article, we'll explain what a crypto wallet is, how it works, and how you can use it to protect your digital assets."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "What is a crypto wallet?", "output": "Crypto wallets are software tools that enable users to securely access, manage, and interact with their cryptocurrencies by storing their cryptographic keys. These cryptographic keys (also known as public and private keys) allow users to access digital assets on the blockchain."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "How do crypto wallets work?", "output": "Contrary to popular opinion, crypto wallets don’t actually “store your crypto.” Instead, they store your public and private keys, which let you access your crypto assets. When you sign up for a crypto wallet, two keys are created: a public key and a private key. Think of public keys as a mailbox where anyone can email you if they have its address. In contrast, private keys act as the “password” to this mailbox, and can access all stored emails or change its settings. Here’s an example of a public key on your Phantom wallet:"}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Custodial vs self-custody crypto wallets", "output": "Custodial and self-custodial wallets primarily differ in who owns the private key of your account. When you create an account on a crypto exchange, the exchange generates a wallet for you and holds your private key. In doing so, they act as the \"custodian\" of your wallet. However, this also means they have direct access to your funds, which could potentially be used for various purposes, such as lending or investing, without your explicit permission or knowledge. Some crypto exchanges have also been known to restrict withdrawals in case of market downturns. Self-custodial wallets are the solution to this problem. In self-custodial wallets, you have true ownership of your funds. No third party can access your private key, which means you’re responsible for storing and securing it."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Types of self-custody wallets and why use Phantom?", "output": "There are primarily two types of self-custodial wallets: hardware and software. Hardware wallets, like Ledger, are physical devices that generate and store your private keys offline.  While these wallets are typically adopted as long-term storage solutions, they require an upfront investment and are less convenient for day-to-day transactions. Phantom supports Ledger hardware wallets. Simply import your existing Ledger accounts and you’re ready to go. On the other hand, software wallets generate and store your private keys in the wallet itself, and offer a more convenient way to access your crypto. Software wallets exist as browser extensions and mobile apps. As a self-custodial software wallet, Phantom provides a safe and intuitive way to manage your assets, trade NFTs, and connect to your favorite dapps across Ethereum, Polygon, and Solana. Phantom is 100% free and offers a few key advantages that set it apart from other software wallets:"}

{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "What can you do with crypto wallets?", "output": "Since their inception, wallets have evolved significantly in terms of functionality and purpose. In the early days, wallets primarily served as secure storage for private keys, granting access to one's cryptocurrency assets. Today, however, wallets have become indispensable tools for engaging with a multitude of blockchain-based services and applications. They now act as gateways, enabling users to interact seamlessly with various aspects of the blockchain ecosystem."}

{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Key takeaways:", "output": "Crypto and volatility go hand in hand, right? Every time you invest in a digital asset, you're taking a gamble on the unpredictable price fluctuations. This can make it hard to time your investments and plan your portfolio. However, there's a class of crypto specifically designed to maintain a stable value: stablecoins. In this article, we’ll walk through what they are, why they matter, and how you can use them."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "What are stablecoins?", "output": "Stablecoins are relatively stable cryptocurrencies that work by pegging their value 1:1 to other assets like fiat currencies, gold, or other cryptoassets. That means you can exchange a stablecoin for an equivalent amount of the asset they're pegged to. For instance, USDT (or Tether) is pegged to the US dollar, which means every USDT can be exchanged for one dollar. There are quite a few innovative ways that stablecoins maintain their peg. Let’s look at some of them."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Types of stablecoins", "output": "There are different types of stablecoins based on methods used to stabilize their value: collateralized, algorithmic, and hybrid. Algorithmic stablecoins automatically adjust the supply based on demand for that coin. On the other hand, collateralized “traditional” stablecoins typically use reserves held by custodians or trustees. Hybrid stablecoins are a mix of both collateralized and algorithmic stablecoins. Each one has its own benefits and weaknesses, but for beginners, we recommend sticking with collateralized stablecoins as they're the most secure and widely-used. Let’s look at some of the most common collateralized stablecoins."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Fiat-Backed stablecoins", "output": "As the name suggests, fiat-backed stablecoins use fiat currencies like USD and EUR as collateral. The key advantage of these types of stablecoins is that they're backed by a central-bank-issued currency which is inherently resistant to volatility. The most popular fiat-backed stablecoins include USDC and USDT. Both these currencies have regulated entities in charge of the token supply and storage of the assets that back it. For USDC, this entity is the Massachusetts-based company Circle, and for USDT, it's the Hong-Kong based company iFinex."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Crypto-backed stablecoins", "output": "Crypto-backed stablecoins are backed by a reserve of other cryptocurrencies, instead of traditional assets like fiat currency or commodities. Usually, crypto-backed stablecoins use reputable cryptocurrencies like Ethereum or Bitcoin for their reserves to avoid volatility as much as possible. Further, they're typically over-collateralized, which means they keep more cryptocurrencies than the stablecoins they issue to account for fluctuations in price. For instance, a popular crypto-backed stablecoin is DAI. DAI is issued by MakerDAO and is backed by a pool of other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum. It uses smart contracts to automatically adjust the supply of DAI based on the value of its reserves."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "How stablecoins are used", "output": "Stablecoins act as a bridge between real world currencies and cryptocurrencies. Being able to rely on the value of a token to remain steady opens up a lot of possibilities in crypto."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Transfering and storing value", "output": "Stablecoins are used widely in payments and remittances. You can transfer money across borders without going through complex bank processes or high payment processor fees. Further, people in countries with unstable economies use stablecoins to store and transfer value as they are pegged to a more stable currency like the US dollar."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Trading crypto", "output": "In an industry where the market can go up and down quickly, stablecoins make trading easier. By being able to trade a volatile token for a stable one, stablecoins allow traders to maintain dollar-backed wealth within the cryptocurrency ecosystem, without using a traditional bank. Traders can sell cryptocurrencies for stablecoins to secure profits or use stablecoins to invest quickly at the right moment."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "DeFi", "output": "Stablecoins have become an important part of the DeFi ecosystem — like providing liquidity or collateral for borrowing and lending. The stability of stablecoins makes them an ideal form of collateral, as the lender can be confident that the value of the collateral will not suddenly drop."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Getting started with stablecoins", "output": "Ready to get started with stablecoins? Phantom’s makes it easy to purchase, sell, and swap USDC directly within the wallet.

{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Key takeaways", "output": "Web3’s decentralized nature has led to the emergence of many distinct blockchains and applications. For example, you can use decentralized finance (DeFi) applications on Ethereum, trade NFTs on Solana, or explore Polygon’s rapidly growing ecosystem. However, these blockchains are independent of each other, i.e., they can’t talk to each other. That's where bridges come in. Just like you exchange money while traveling to different countries, blockchain bridges allow you to transfer assets across various blockchains. Crypto bridges are the key to a connected, decentralized future, where assets and data flow freely across different platforms. In this article, we’ll explain what bridges are, how they work, and how you can get started."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "What are crypto bridges?", "output": "Crypto bridges are essentially software protocols that enable communication and interaction between different blockchains. Think of it as similar to building a bridge between two islands so people can travel back and forth. Crypto bridges allow two different blockchain networks to share information and work together. Crypto bridges work by establishing a connection between two different blockchain networks, allowing the transfer of assets and data between them. They do this by maintaining unified liquidity pools and unique resource balancing algorithms. These liquidity pools have native assets linked to all chains at the same time, allowing for efficient swaps. With crypto bridges, you can directly transfer your assets cross-chain with a few clicks. This helps you avoid the traditional process of sending assets to a centralized exchange, trading them for another asset and then withdrawing the asset. Crypto bridges, thus, eliminate any potential transaction delays and the need for trusting a centralized exchange. Further, since centralized exchanges typically charge a percentage of your assets to trade on them, you will also likely save on fees while using a decentralized bridge."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Accessing other blockchains and ecosystems", "output": "Crypto bridges provide a gateway to explore different blockchain ecosystems. This is especially useful when chains like Ethereum become congested due to high user activity. With bridges, you can simply move your assets to another network like Solana. By bridging your assets to Solana, you can take advantage of the lower transaction costs and faster transaction speeds. For instance, you can use decentralized apps (dapps), like Jupiter or Raydium on Solana instead of Ethereum after bridging your assets. This allows you to participate in DeFi activities, such as staking, liquidity provision, and trading, at a reduced cost compared to the Ethereum network. "}

{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Vulnerability Overview", "output": "With the \"Demonic\" vulnerability, users who imported their browser extension crypto wallet using a secret recovery phrase were at risk of having their secret recovery phrase exposed. If a sufficiently advanced attacker was able to exploit another vulnerability and obtain physical or logical access to the device, they would be able to retrieve the secret phrase and gain access to the wallet. Many major non-custodial cryptocurrency wallets with browser extensions were potentially affected by this issue, including Phantom, Metamask, Brave, and more. The discovery of \"Demonic\" revealed a new vector of attack for crypto wallets called key-finding. These attacks target the running memory of a process for specific sensitive credentials. Using the standard BIP39 mnemonic input field could make many browser extension wallets vulnerable to this type of attack."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Phantom’s Solution", "output": "We are ecstatic to welcome Oussama Amri, who originally discovered the threat last year while part of Halborn, to the Phantom team as a security engineer. And thanks to the hard work of engineers, Josiah Savary and Laamia Islam, not only have substantial parts of our codebase changed, but we have also completely rewritten how we generate seed phrases. After some additional audits are completed this summer, we plan to open-source our approach to the BIP-39 package for seed generation so other crypto wallets can also better protect themselves and their users. Please note that details of this vulnerability were kept confidential until all alerted parties could adequately address the threat. We are proud of the collaborative effort that went into keeping our users and the larger crypto community safe."}

This package includes starter files, setup and usage instructions, and a live demo showcasing multiple UI frameworks."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Connecting", "output": "The recommended and easiest way to connect to Phantom is by calling window.phantom.solana.connect(). However, the provider also exposes a request JSON RPC interface. The connect() call will return a Promise that resolves when the user accepts the connection request, and reject (throw when awaited) when the user declines the request or closes the pop-up. See Errors for a breakdown of error messages Phantom may emit. When the user accepts the request to connect, the provider will also emit a connect event. Once the web application is connected to Phantom, it will be able to read the connected account's public key and prompt the user for additional transactions. It also exposes a convenience isConnected boolean."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Eagerly Connecting", "output": "After a web application connects to Phantom for the first time, it becomes trusted. Once trusted, it's possible for the application to automatically connect to Phantom on subsequent visits or page refreshes, without prompting the user for permission. This is referred to as \"eagerly connecting\". To implement this, applications should pass an onlyIfTrusted option into the connect() call. If this flag is present, Phantom will only eagerly connect and emit a connect event if the application is trusted. If the application is not trusted, Phantom will throw a 4001 error and remain disconnected until the user is prompted to connect without an onlyIfTrusted flag. In either case, Phantom will not open a pop-up window, making this convenient to use on all page loads. The following is an example of how a React application can eagerly connect to Phantom. For a live demo, please refer to the handleConnect portion of our sandbox. If a wallet disconnects from a trusted app and then attempts to reconnect at a later time, Phantom will still eagerly connect. Once an app is trusted, Phantom will only require the user to approve a connection request if the user revokes the app from within their Trusted Apps settings."}

If accepted, Phantom will sign the transaction with the user's private key and submit it via a Solana JSON RPC connection. By far the easiest and most recommended way of doing this is by using the signAndSendTransaction method on the provider, but it is also possible to do with request. In both cases, the call will return a Promise for an object containing the signature. You can also specify a SendOptions object as a second argument into signAndSendTransaction or as an options parameter when using request.

The only difference is that developers should use the VersionedTransaction class rather than the Transaction class. The following example show how to build a simple transfer instruction. Once the transfer instruction is made, a MessageV0 formatted transaction message is constructed with the transfer instruction.

These structures can then be referenced to significantly increase the number of accounts that can be loaded in a single transaction. This lookup method effectively \"compresses\" a 32-byte address into a 1-byte index value. This \"compression\" enables storing up to 256 address in a single lookup table for use inside any given transaction. With the @solana/web3.js createLookupTable function, developers can construct the instruction needed to create a new lookup table, as well as determine its address. Once we have the lookup table instruction, we can construct a transaction, sign it, and send it to create a lookup table on-chain. Address lookup tables can be created with either a v0 transaction or a legacy transaction. However, the Solana runtime can only retrieve and handle the additional addresses within a lookup table while using v0 transactions. Here's a code snippet that creates a Lookup Table. Please refer to the handleSignAndSendTransactionV0WithLookupTable() in our code sandbox for a live demo of creating a lookup table."}

Marinade is Solana’s first-ever liquid staking solution. Founded in March 2021 at a DeFi hackathon, and funded via grants, this saucy provider delivered Solana’s first liquid staking token, mSOL, in August 2021. On Marinade, you stake your SOL and receive mSOL. As your staked SOL earns rewards, they’ll be distributed distributed directly into the price of mSOL. Next, is Jito, an MEV-powered liquid staking provider. When you stake with Jito, you receive yield-bearing JitoSOL and rewards in the form of points. Plus, the additional profits from Jito’s MEV validators are then redistributed to JitoSOL and its point program, which creates a positive flywheel. Lastly, a promising, newer Solana liquid staking option is SolBlaze. The SolBlaze stake pool works similarly to the ones from Marinade and Jito. But a key difference is that, when staking with SolBlaze, you don't receive mSOL or JitoSOL, but yield-bearing bSOL and its corresponding rewards. So, what’s the point? With the top Solana liquid staking providers, you can lock up your SOL and receive a liquid staking token (LST)—such as mSOL, JitoSOL, or bSOL—then deploy it in DeFi in search of greater returns."}

While we were able to help hundreds of thousands of users claim their airdrop, the massive usage overloaded our data infrastructure with too many concurrent connections. So, what happened? Several factors contributed to this issue. The huge spike in traffic exhausted our available connections to our database. This resulted in timeouts when attempting to connect to Allium, leading to over 20,000 concurrent Lambda executions. We then raised our concurrent execution limit to 30,000. Eventually, Allium increased its limits, and we re-deployed our Lambdas to clear idle connections, but problems persisted. After further investigation, we discovered that we had reached the limit of simultaneous connections through our NAT Gateway. In essence, our services reached the default AWS limit for simultaneous network connections. It seems these connections, or at least ports, remained in use even after the lambdas were cleaned up, extending the duration of the outage. This eventually resolved itself over time. While we did our best to prepare, this was a great learning lesson ahead of JUP."}

{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Introduction", "output": "Solana’s fast and cheap transactions make it the perfect testing ground for novel mobile applications. Until recently, however, there was no way for native mobile apps to interact with existing Solana wallets. In order to connect to users, Solana dapps had to be web-based. In a mobile context, these web dapps were most often viewed within a wallet’s in-app browser. All of this changed in Phantom v22.04.01 with the release of Phantom deeplinks. With deeplinks, iOS and Android apps can now interact directly with the Phantom mobile app to connect, sign, and send transactions. In this tutorial, we’ll walk through how you can integrate Phantom deeplinks into your Solana mobile application."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "What are deeplinks?", "output": "If you've ever created a link using an HTML <a> tag, you're probably familiar with the mailto: scheme. Unlike a normal url that directs users straight to a website (i.e. href=\"<https://google.com>\"), the mailto: scheme tells the operating system that it should instead open the email application. Once open, your email app can then parse the url to present a rich user experience. For example, the url href=\"mailto:[email protected]?subject=Deeplinking Tutorial Feedback&body=Hi Brian,\" will compose an email to me with both a subject and body already pre-configured. These url schemes are often referred to as deeplinks. Just like using the mailto: scheme, other applications can also link to each other by using their own custom url schemes. When developing a mobile application, we can specify our own protocol handler (such as: discord:// or phantom://) and create deeplinks that tell the operating system to open our native app. We can even take it a step further: using a concept known as universal links, we can create deeplinks based on regular https:// urls for a domain that we control. This comes with the added benefits of being more secure, as well as a better user experience in cases where users have yet to install our app. Phantom supports both universal links ( https://phantom.app/ul/ ) as well as a custom protocol handler (phantom:// ). For the remainder of this tutorial, we'll focus on Phantom's universal links and refer to these collectively as deeplinks."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "What we're building", "output": "To showcase the power of Phantom deeplinks, we'll be creating a mobile app that can interact with a program (aka smart contract) on Solana. Specifically, we’re going to be building a mobile-version of the movie reviews dapp from module 1 of the Solana Development Course. For the purposes of this tutorial, we won’t be writing any Solana programs ourselves. The Solana Development Course already does a great job of teaching that! Instead, we’ll be writing a mobile app that interacts with the course’s program which already exists on devnet. Once complete, our app will let users sign in and send reviews using Phantom. All in all, it'll look a little something like this:"}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Overview", "output": "This tutorial covers 3 main sections: Creating our mobile app using React Native and Expo CLI"}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Prerequisites", "output": "Before we can build anything, we first need to install the necessary command-line tools. Chief amongst these are Node.js and Expo CLI. If you don’t have Node yet, I recommend installing it via Node Version Manager (NVM). Before proceeding, you should be able to run the following commands in your terminal. I developed mine with the following versions: In addition to our laptop’s development environment, we’ll also want a phone to test our React Native app. One of the many benefits of Expo is that it makes it easy to test your app on a physical device throughout the development process. Before proceeding, make sure to install both the Expo and Phantom mobile apps from your phone’s official app store."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Scaffolding our React Native app", "output": "With the necessary tools installed, we can get started with our app. To recap: we’re going to be building a mobile app for the movie reviews program in the Solana Development Course. Instead of rehashing the lessons from that course, I’ve added the necessary components to a starter repo located on our GitHub. To get started, simply fork the repo and clone it to your local developer environment: Then, change into the project directory and install the necessary dependencies: Once you’ve installed the dependencies, you can fire up the app with: From here, your terminal should present you with a large QR code. Go ahead and grab your phone, open the camera app, and scan the QR code that is present on your laptop’s terminal. If you’re using an Android phone, you may need to scan it from within the Expo mobile app. If all goes well, your code should begin bundling and your phone will open the mobile app from the video above. Go ahead and try scrolling and searching within the app. If you’ve already completed the Solana Development Course’s module on Deserializing Custom Account Data, then this should look pretty familiar. Here, our app is fetching reviews from the course’s program and then paginating and filtering the results based on how far you scroll or what you search. If you take a look at our starter repo, you’ll see that the MovieList.tsx and MovieCoordinator.ts components from the course have already been integrated into our React Native app under the components directory. For the purposes of this tutorial, we won’t be going into detail over how these are working under the hood. If you’re interested in learning more here, be sure to check out the Solana Development Course! After playing around with our app, we can see that we’re already reading and displaying movies reviews that are stored on Solana. How would we go about adding new reviews? If you were to tap on the “Connect Phantom” button, you’ll see that nothing happens. Let’s see what’s going on by opening up the App.tsx file at the root of directory: We’ll be focusing mostly on this file for the majority of our walkthrough. Looking at our App.tsx component, you can see right off the bat that our app is looking to store a phantomWalletPublicKey. If we look down at what is returned from this component, you’ll see that if this phantomWalletPublicKey exists, we’ll render a button that lets us add a new movie review. Otherwise, we’ll return a “Connect Phantom” button:  We can also see that our connect function is currently lacking functionality: Let’s go ahead and change that!"}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Connecting our app to Phantom", "output": "When we first introduced the concept of deeplinking, we compared it to clicking on a mailto: link. In React Native, however, there are no <a> tags for us to work with. Instead, we can use the expo-linking package to create and open URLs from within our app. Let’s use this package to try and connect to Phantom from within our connect function. Taking a look at Phantom’s documentation, we can see that the URL needed to deeplink into Phantom’s connect method is: https://phantom.app/ul/v1/connect. Let’s try a naive approach by replacing our connect method with the following:  Turning back to our phone, let’s try tapping on our “Connect Phantom” button again. This time, we should instantly teleport over to our Phantom app. Pretty cool!"}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Handling Encryption", "output": "When using deeplinks, all communication between our app and Phantom will be encrypted by default. We can achieve this encryption via a simple key exchange known as Diffie-Hellman. In the same way that a Phantom user has a keypair made of up a public key (i.e. their Solana address) and a private key (managed by Phantom), our app will create its own keypair specific to its connection with Phantom. During a Diffie-Hellman exchange, our app will then share its public key in the initial connect request to Phantom. Once it receives our public key, Phantom will then generate its own keypair that’s unique to our app. When sending a connect response back to our app, Phantom will also share its corresponding public key with our app. Once both parties have each other’s public keys, they can then combine them with their own private keys that they did not share and end up with the same result. The beauty of this process is that while neither party shared any sensitive information (both only shared public keys), they can now reliably create the same secret that can be used for encrypting messages. We’ll refer to this secret as the shared secret."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Specifying Redirects", "output": "Whenever we make a deeplinking request to Phantom, we’ll also need to tell Phantom how to get back to our app. We can do this by creating our own set of deeplinks for our React Native app. Specifically, we can create a deeplink for receiving a Phantom connect event and include that as the redirect_link in our initial request. Once again, the expo-linking package can help us achieve this. First, we’ll need to specify our own app’s URL scheme, just like how Phantom specifies phantom://. We can do this from within our app.json file. Here, I’ve already set us up with deep-links-movie-tutorial://. Next, we’ll need to create the URL endpoint we want to pass as our redirect_link. Let’s call this onConnect. We can create this URL from within App.tsx like so: Now that we have a valid URL that Phantom can redirect back to, we’ll need a way for our app to actually listen for in-bound links. There are two scenarios in which our app could be opened with this link. In the first case, because our app is already open and running, we can simply listen for a url event and track the incoming URL: In the second scenario, we can’t rely on just listening for the event because our app may not already be open when the event is fired. To account for this, we should make sure we always call Linking.getInitialURL on our app startup: Finally, we’ll need some way of actually parsing the inbound link from Phantom and responding to it accordingly. Whenever we receive a deeplink that matches the onConnect URL we specified earlier, we know we’ll be dealing with a connect response. We can handle this like so:"}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Making a proper request to Phantom", "output": "Now that we have all of the necessary components, it’s time for us to make a proper connect request to Phantom. To recap, our connect request requires four parameters: When interacting with deeplinks, we can specify additional parameters by simply appending them to the base URL as query string parameters. Let’s put all these pieces together and try making a new connect request. Go ahead and update your App.tsx file with the following: Now, when we tap our “Connect Phantom” button, we should also see a connect modal pop up from within Phantom. When we approve this request by tapping “Connect”, Phantom should then redirect us back to our app. Progress!"}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Putting it all together", "output": "Let’s take a look at our console to see what Phantom is sending back to our app. If you take a look your console, you should see that we’re logging a URL that looks something like this: Recall that when we made our connect request to Phantom, we passed additional data such as our app_url and dapp_encryption_public_key as query string parameters. Now that we have a response, we can see that the URL we’re logging from Phantom also has additional data at the following query string parameters: Taking a closer look at these query string parameters, you’ll see now that all data from Phantom has been encrypted. In particular, the data field sent back from Phantom is now an encrypted JSON string. Let’s go ahead and decrypt it! When we made our connect request to Phantom, we passed along our dapp_encryption_public_key that Phantom could use to generate a shared secret on its side. Now that Phantom has passed us back its phantom_encryption_public_key, we can also generate this shared secret and complete the Diffie-Hellman key exchange needed to decrypt the data. We can do this by decoding the phantom_encryption_public_key received from Phantom and combining it with our app’s dappKeyPair.secretKey like so: Moving over to our utils folder, let’s create a new file named decryptPayload.ts and add the following function: Here, we’re creating a helper function that will decrypt a given data string using the sharedSecret we just generated in our Diffie-Hellman key exchange and the nonce passed back from Phantom. With this method now in place, we can now decrypt the data passed back from Phantom: Taking a look at our console, we should see that our app has decoded the data from Phantom to an object that has public_key and session fields: Here, the public_key that Phantom passes us is the public key of the end user. The session we receive is specific to this user and represents our user’s connection to our app. Our app should continue to pass this session param back to Phantom to authenticate all subsequent requests. As long as this session is valid, we should consider this user “connected” to our app. With this data now decrypted, we can go ahead and store both the public_key and session received from Phantom. Let’s update our App.tsx file with the following:  Now, when we approve our connect request, our app should recognize that the request was successful and render “Add Review” and “Disconnect” buttons. We’re now officially connected!"}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Notes on Sessions", "output": "From here on out, all communication with Phantom will require the session param that our app has stored. This session does not expire, and will represent our connection to Phantom until it is deemed invalid. There are two scenarios in which a session can be deemed invalid: In cases where our app loses this session (such as if a user force closes our app) we should simply consider the user disconnected and require a new connection before continuing."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Disconnecting From Phantom", "output": "Before we continue on to adding movie reviews to our app, we should also give our users a way to disconnect. Disconnecting follows much of the same process as connecting. Namely, we will make a deeplink to Phantom that: We’ve already covered most of the heavy lifting here in our initial connect request. To set ourselves up for future requests, let’s refactor some of our existing connect logic. First, let’s add the following line to our constants/index.ts file: Next, create a new file within our utils folder named buildUrl.ts and add the following function. This will make it easier for us to construct different Phantom deeplinks in the future: If we take a look at the query string parameters required for disconnect, we can see that most of it looks similar to our initial connect request. This time, however, we will also need to encrypt a payload in our request to Phantom. Remember, our encrypted channel with Phantom works both ways! To set ourselves up for encrypting future requests, let’s create a new file under our utils folder named encryptPayload.ts and add the following: Here, we’re using the sharedSecret we generated from our Diffie-Hellman key exchange to encrypt some arbitrary payload that we will send to Phantom. As part of this encryption process, we’ll also generate a nonce that we’ll send to Phantom so that Phantom can decrypt our payload. Switching over to our App.tsx file, we can now add the necessary components to make a disconnect deeplink and handle its corresponding redirect link back from Phantom. First, we’ll need to create a redirect link: Then, we’ll need a way to handle this incoming redirect link. In the case of disconnect, Phantom doesn’t return us anything—we should simply forget our users phantomWalletPublicKey as our session would no longer be valid: With our redirect route in place, we can finally build and open our disconnect deeplink. Note that we are encrypting a payload to Phantom that includes our session param from earlier. We will need to pass this to Phantom to authenticate all subsequent requests! Once all this in place, our app should be able to quickly connect and disconnect like so:"}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Signing and sending transactions via Phantom", "output": "Now that our users can connect and disconnect from our app, we’re finally ready to give them the ability to write their own movie reviews. So far, we’ve just been reading reviews created by other people who have interacted with the program that’s already on devnet. Now, our users can write their own reviews and use Phantom to broadcast them to the network. If you tap on our existing “Add Review” button, you’ll see a form pop up that asks for a movie’s title, review, and rating. All of this is already set up for us within components/AddReviewSheet.tsx. I won’t rehash everything in here, since the Solana Development Course already does a great job of explaining how to interact with their existing program. If we look at our handleSubmit function, however, we can see that we’re already constructing our review as a TransactionInstruction and then packaging it into a Transaction. This transaction now needs to be signed and submitted to the Solana network. Let’s zoom back out to our App.tsx file. Here, we’ll need to add much of the same deeplinking flows that we’ve already covered. Specifically, we’ll need: Go ahead and try your hand at implementing the first two items from our list above.

Phantom supports the Wallet Standard and is open to working with others to bring this innovation to other ecosystems."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Motivation", "output": "Most desktop wallets today come in the form of browser extensions. These extensions interact with dApps by injecting code in the form of a provider into every website the user visits. There are several issues with the way injection works today: While wallets often injected into their own designated namespace (e.g. window.phantom), there is nothing stopping another wallet from injecting into the same namespace. Furthermore, any wallet can attempt to mimic another by changing its identifier flags (e.g. window.solana.isPhantom = true). As a result, users who have multiple injected wallets can often experience unwanted interferences. Since wallets attach themselves to the window as global objects, dApps need to be made aware of how they can find these objects. Instead of automatically detecting all wallets that the user has installed, a dApp must choose to support a limited number of wallets that may not be relevant to the user. Wallets inconsistently support features such as signing and sending transactions, signing more than one transaction, signing a \"message\" (arbitrary byte array), and encryption and decryption. To the extent they support these features, wallets may have different interfaces which can make integrations complex and time consuming."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Wallet-Standard Overview", "output": "Wallet Standard addresses these issues by introducing an event-based model that At a high-level, Wallet Standard defines the following Window interface for events: When a wallet is ready to inject into a website, it will dispatch a register-wallet event and listen for an app-ready event. Conversely, an app will dispatch an app-ready event and listen for register-wallet events."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Phantom: ", "input": "Features of Wallet Standard", "output": "Before Wallet Standard, if a dApp wanted to support 20 wallets, it had to load 5kb of code per wallet (100k total). This bloating increases linearly as the number of wallets increase. The vast majority of this code goes unused, as the user will only use one or two wallets. Wallet Standard turns this inside out: If dapps want to support 100 wallets, they just to support Wallet Standard. Any wallet that supports the standard is will automatically be detected and supported. Implementations are replaced with interfaces. Before Wallet Standard, every new wallet had to land a PR in a library such as the Solana Wallet Adapter. Library maintainers had to vet hundreds of PRs to ensure they weren't introducing malware into the adapter. By eliminating plugins, these libraries can now eliminate attack surfaces. While Wallet Standard was pioneered on Solana, it is chain-agnostic by default. An example EIP-1193 implementation can be found here. Wallet Standard will always input and output transactions, pubkeys, and signatures as raw bytes (Uint8Array). As such, there are no dependencies for web3.js ."}

{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: DeFi Foundations", "input": "Blockchain Basics", "output": "Blockchainsare ever-expanding ledgers of transactions. They have a handful of qualities that differentiate them from traditional computing networks, and they open doors to entirely new ways of doing things. They’re intended to becensorship-resistant,immutablerecord sources withinteroperablecapabilities. Immutable in the sense that these transactions can not be reversed and interoperable in the sense that blockchain accounts can seamlessly interact with other accounts and applications. Transactions on a blockchain are grouped into blocks and are verified by adistributednetwork of computers that earn money for participating in the verification process. The term distributed refers to the idea that these computers are not governed by any central entity but rather a widespread collection of individual entities. This network collectively puts together a public ledger that can be indexed and searched with extreme detail. Anything that happens on a public blockchain is immediately and immutably a part of the public record. Each account on a blockchain is accessed with a digital wallet. Accounts hold an individual or entity’s tokens which can be freely transferred between wallets and interact with applications that are compatible with the wallet. These applications can be financial or used for gaming, messaging, and virtually anything else. When proper security measures are practiced, only a wallet user has access to its contents. For a deeper dive into non-custodial wallets, check out this article from Solflare’s Knowledge Base. Unlike traditional markets, blockchains operate at all hours of the day, so on-chain markets are running 24/7, and transactions can’t be reversed. Anyone with a wallet can partake in them, and all transactions are final."}

{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: DeFi Foundations", "input": "Digital Economies", "output": "When you combine the above ingredients into a network of people and computers worldwide, you begin opening the door to a new paradigm. A paradigm where banks and brokers don’t stand between you and your money. A paradigm where algorithms verify and prove that events took place rather than you having to trust a banker, broker, or government entity. Blockchains can’t lie. Using the tools of self-custody and non-custodial wallets, individuals can now be their banks and brokers. All they need to do is generate a digital wallet like Solflare. Digital wallets are cryptographically secure locations for you to interact with your digital assets, and they can be accessed with 12-24 word mnemonic phrases, known colloquially as recovery phrases or seed phrases.Anyone with a wallet’s phrase can access the said wallet, so it’s imperative that only you have access to your wallet.Learn more about recovery phrases at the link below. You can store a near-infinite amount of cryptocurrencies and NFTs (non-fungible tokens) in a single wallet. Using a single recovery phrase, you can generate and access a near-infinite amount of wallets.These wallets don’t store your assets but are an interface for you to interact with them.Blockchain assets are on-chain at all times, so as long as you have access to your wallet and the blockchain you use is working, you’ll have access to your digital assets. Let that sink in. It’s not hard to realize how profound this is. Rather than carry $100,000,000 in cash, you can now remember a 12-24 word phrase that gives you access to a digital wallet with 100,000,000 USDC in it, and no one can ever take that from you – unless you get scammed or give away your secret phrase. USDC is a stablecoin that attempts to retain parity with the dollar, so 1 USDC = $1. If USDC were to depeg, then that’d be an issue. Such was the case withUST, adecentralizedalgorithmic stablecoin."}

There were no decentralized computing networks with blockchain functionality until Bitcoin came around. Bitcoin, as a cryptocurrency, only exists because of the underlying Bitcoin blockchain that continuously verifies transactions and adds newblocksto itsdistributed ledger. As its value increased by over 83,000,000% in a decade, an entire industry formed around it and stands at the bleeding edge of technology, finance, game theory, and distributed systems.

The programs themselves can be simple protocols that let you buy a jpeg image or trade the Ethereum cryptocurrency for another token, or they can be complicated financial wizardry that is difficult to explain. Ethereum has a long and colorful history that is expertly outlined inThe Infinite Machine: How an Army of Crypto-hackers Is Building the Next Internet with Ethereum. Refer to that text or a similar book,The Cryptopians: Idealism, Greed, Lies, and the Making of the First Big Cryptocurrency Craze, for a thorough account of Ethereum. For the scope of this course, it’s essential to understand that Ethereum and a new programming language called Solidity were developed to serve as a global settlement layer and to enable developers to build any complete program or protocol on top of it. This is a vague and ambiguous way of describing the function of what you can do with a distributed ledger – or a database. The programs can be simple protocols that let you buy a jpeg image or trade the Ethereum cryptocurrency for another token. They can be complicated financial wizardry that is difficult to explain. Ethereum developers built a series of protocols compiled into the ERC20 standard. ERC20 refers to the fungible token standard on Ethereum. Ethereum, unlike Bitcoin, lets you develop and release any customized token. The economics of the token – the distribution schedule, etc. – is referred to as tokenomics. Ethereum hit the ground running in 2014, and by 2017, a massive bubble had inflated around ERC20 token raises. Companies were issuing tokens in exchange for Ethereum or other cryptocurrencies by making an ICO – an initial coin offering. It’s comparable to traditional finance’s IPO – an initial public offering but requires far less due diligence and regulatory oversight. As a result of this craze, Bitcoin and Ethereum hit fresh all-time highs as retail investor demand went through the roof. It’s clear now that many of the companies involved in the 2017 debacle were fraudulent or inadequate. Still, at the time, they were taking advantage of a novel and unregulated technology very early in its infancy. The internet’s dot com bubble in the early 2000s had a similar effect. Greedy people saw smart people making money and tried to get in on it. From 2017 to now, prices have been volatile, but builders have kept building. Ethereum has boasted a hefty$160 billionworth of digital assets on-chain at its peak and continuously confirmsover a million transactions per day. Ethereum, and all blockchains, are known asLayer 1s. They are the ultimate settlement layer on which all applications are built. When referring to Layer 1s that arenotBitcoin or Ethereum, industry pundits call themAlt Layer 1s. These blockchains may offer outsized rewards with a more considerable risk involved or be defunct and bereft of users. The classic alt layer one trade in 2021 wasSoLunAvaxwhich referred to buying and holding the Solana coin, Luna coin, and Avax (Avalanche) coin. Solana is thriving and has healthy organic growth metrics. Avalanche has a reasonably robust community. Unfortunately, Luna went to zero in 2022, bringing it down roughly $60 billion worth of value (UST and LUNA). Read more about Luna’s downfall here. New blockchains usually have no interest in being like Bitcoin. They’re usually variations of Ethereum’s structure (referred to as EVM compatible – Luna, Avax, Near, etc.), or they’re looking to iterate on other blockchain architecture (Solana) and consistently begin with building what become known as the DeFi stack. We’ll go over that in the next chapter."}

Compared to other fields, traditional finance is not that traditional – its fundamental structure has only been in place for about 80 years, which is considered modern compared to the humanities. Finance is grossly behind where it needs to be compared to scientific fields like medicine and chemistry. As referenced in Chapter 2, traditional finance today is about as evolved as 16th-century chemistry was. It’s full of alchemy. The cutting edge of traditional finance could be more cutting edge. FinTech technologies like mobile-only banking apps or buy-now-pay-later schemes such asKlarnaare not revolutionary. They’re simply byproducts of what’s possible with a mobile phone.

When sh*t hits the fan, all correlations go to one. These two concepts explain your average investor’s mindset when it comes to risk. The low-risk, low-return, and high-risk, high-return framework have become the de facto understanding of risk for investors over time, and DeFi is no different. Risks in DeFi come in many shapes and sizes, some new and some old. These risks range from smart contract risk (lousy code) to user error (forgetting one’s mnemonic) and everything in between. DeFi and the rest of crypto are highly correlated withrisk-on-techassets. Along with the standard volatility of risk-on tech assets, DeFi users must understand that DeFi is very volatile. There are small-scale scams and large-scale hacks taking place very often, and regulators need to learn how to deal with it all and often can’t go after what they need to. If you want to understand examples of these hacks, go throughRekt’s graveyard. They’re actively going after people and have started sanctioning protocols likeTornado Cashto prevent bad actors from siphoning money into untraceable wallets. To go after a protocol in this manner would require smart contracts to be sanctioned, which is explained further below byHarry.eth, a security researcher fromMetamask. There is even a state-sponsored hacking group calledLazarusthat operates in North Korea, which has attempted toinfiltratecrypto companies and has stolen hundreds of millions, if not billions, over the past few years by exploiting blockchain applications and bridge vulnerabilities. It’s theorized that these funds are being used to fund North Korea’s nuclear program. This isn’t the wild wild west but it’s definitely not for the faint of heart.

When the Nasdaq 100, an index of the top 100 US tech companies, is up 3%, you’ll probably see Bitcoin up 10% and vice versa. This is to say thatcryptocurrencies are high-beta digital assets highly correlated to risk-on-tech assets. These extremes make it easy for people to make AND lose money. Best practices in crypto are to never recommend buying to family members or friends who wouldn’t know what they’re doing. You don’t want to be that guy/girl when prices decide to go the wrong way. When it comes to your own portfolio, that’s up to you."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Onboarding to DeFi", "input": "Away You Go", "output": "You now have a strong enough understanding of the context, technologies, potential, and risks involved in DeFi to research and engage with it on your own. Remember to do your due diligence before investing any significant amount into a cryptocurrency or using aDeFi,NFT, or DAOprotocol. If you found value in the various rabbit holes we went down in this course, you’re in luck. Crypto is full of rabbit holes that have been theorized for decades since thecypherpunkmovement in the early 1990s. Just start researching things likeBretton Woods,Rights toEncryption,Dollar Debasement, etc. It’s, of course, good to hear and understand criticisms. In fact, go ahead and follow no-coiners and othercrypto critics. Some podcasts and individuals make a living pointing out everything wrong with crypto. These people will open your mind to how non-crypto people view blockchain technology (tl;dr, they usually hate it). In the ways that some people are religious zealots for Bitcoin, there are also religious zealots for anti-crypto belief systems. Please refer to F. Scott Fitzgerald’s quote in Chapter 5 to understand what both examples of zealots lack."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Applications", "input": "Today’s Agenda", "output": "We’re covering lots of surface area here. Each of the topics listed below is entire sub-industries within crypto. While a growing number of people devote every day and every dollar to DeFi, NFTs, and DAOs, the segment of the population who is even aware of how to use them is still relatively small. As global adoption metrics, security practices, and education improve, that number will increase. Other than on crypto exchanges, Blockchain applications are where most of the activity in crypto occurs. Apps are built directly on top of a blockchain and will utilize its settlement layer to perform their functions. They can be anything from a messaging service to a trading platform, andon-chain activityrefers to transactions occurring across various applications on various blockchains. An on-chain transaction doesn’t always involve a transfer of value or funds. Trades can also relay messages, cast votes and serve other non-financial purposes. There are thousands of apps built across dozens of blockchains, andmost of their utility and function can be categorized into the DeFi, NFT, or DAO industries. Some apps help users earn yields of billions of dollars, while others are built purely to serve as infrastructure, such as bridges between different blockchains. New types of apps likeLens, an on-chain social network, andRabbit Hole, an on-chain credentialing service, are taking off in popularity, and it will be interesting to see how burgeoning sub-industries like the digital fashion and decentralized science movements evolve.They’re similar to regular websites but use blockchains, a totally different framework than the regular internet,so their capabilities differ. For the purpose of this course, you need to understand the following:"}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Applications", "input": "The Fallacy of Right Click & Saving", "output": "People love to ask NFT owners, “If I right-clicked and saved a screenshot of an NFT, wouldn’t that be the same thing as owning it?” That question is baseless, given the nature of owning digital assets on a blockchain, so it’s best practice not to ask it. These apes are not being compared to the Mona Lisa but from a financial and philosophical perspective –owning a copy of the Mona Lisa is not the same as owning the Mona Lisa.The above question becomes incredibly hackneyed when you consider that NFTs can represent real-world assets. Propy, for example, lets you tokenize the deed to your house and sell it on a blockchain as an NFT. No 30-day closing period is required."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Applications", "input": "DAOs: Decentralized Autonomous Organizations", "output": "Blockchain applications that fit into these three categories include even more sub-categories than what’s been listed. Still, for the scope of the next chapter, we’re focusing on DeFi applications – in particular, DEXes (Decentralized Exchanges). DEXes are an aspect of the DeFi world that enables, here’s this word again,permission-lesstransactions of digital assets. The way they do so is relatively complex, so we’ll deal with that in another course. Let’s discuss why this concept of permissionlessness keeps coming up."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Applications", "input": "Permission", "output": "The idea of asking for permission to make a transaction sounds a bit odd, but it is what 99.9% of the world is doing. The other 0.1% is taking part in DeFi or a barter network. In a barter network, you act within a P2P (Peer to Peer) framework with no central intermediary. If I have 10 chickens but want 1 cow, and you have 1 cow but want 10 chickens, and we both value 10 chickens per 1 cow, I can trade my chicken to you for your cow, and we’ll both be happy. DeFi enables this same P2P framework but in the context of digital assets. Let’s take the DEX mentioned above example. DEXes enable the permissionless transaction of digital assets by implementing liquidity pools. Liquidity pools are effective services governed by on-chain software that facilitate the transfers ofliquidity, or on-hand capital, that traders can use to make trades. There is no company and no CEO involved with any transaction on a DEX, so no company or CEO canstopany transaction. These liquidity poolsdon’tjust close at 4 PM ET like the New York Stock Exchange does. They are 24/7 mechanisms that exist as long as the blockchain they are on exists. They are a series of processes, otherwise known as a protocol, and many can exist without human input or monitoring. When compared to a CEX (centralized exchange), DEXes are revolutionary. Rather than deal with 5-10 various TradFi intermediaries to handle your funds and trade lifecycles for you, you can do it all on your own. These 5-10 intermediaries cause many issues that make finance less transparent, less democratic, and more counterparty-dependent. Blockchains aim to eliminate this dependence by serving as immutable sources of record on which other applications, like DEXes, can base their activity. The DEX doesn’t have to worry about who’s in the custody of your assets because only you can be unless you lose yourmnemonic/recovery phrase."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Applications", "input": "Regulatory Uncertainty and Counterparty Risk", "output": "In TradFi, your location may restrict you from accessing certain services, like crypto derivatives in the USA. US crypto traders are given a different opportunity than non-US crypto traders, and the reasons behind that are reasonably nuanced. Long story short, US agencies like the SEC are not transparent with their opinions. As a result, crypto exchanges want to avoid getting in trouble in the future, so they generally don’t offer derivatives or as many token listings in the US as they do internationally. This regulatory framework ultimately hurts US investors as they are left with a small selection of tokens to choose from and disingenuous public market instruments like an ETF of futures contracts following BTC’s price. The regulatory uncertainty also impacts the country’s economy as a whole, as developers and other human resources are gravitating towards and generating economic value in regions with favorable regulations. This concept, known asjurisdictional arbitrage, is a growing trend in this digital age. It’s an example of a second-order effect of slow and backward policies. If your location doesn’t seem like an issue in your investing activities, you still have a lot to deal with. The grossly misrepresented and excessive counter-party risk in traditional finance became evident throughout the 2008 financial crisis. Of course, many factors were at play, but there’s no doubt that the contagion of collateralized debt obligations, worth around $2 trillion, set the recession in motion. This debt, secured against thousands of low-quality residential mortgages that ultimately defaulted, generated enormous counter-party risk that the system could not handle whenthe music stopped. In other words,there were massive checks but no balances."}

Evidence of that is new international reserve currencies come about every few centuries. Billionaire investor and Bitcoin advocateRay Dahlio– among others, theorizes that the current reserve status of the USD is declining and that other currencies will rise in global prominence. While compelling, this theory stands in contention with other geopolitical commentators such asPeter Zeihan, who refers to falling populations and supply chain issues halting the advancements of many emerging markets over the next century. Peter argues that the global macroeconomic environment has moved into an unprecedented territory and that the previous framework won’t accommodate what will happen. Also compelling. Who’s to say the next global reserve currency isn’t going to be a decentralized one?"}

During this time, you saw many open-source projects proliferate and innovate on one another’s ideas rapidly. A group of protocols such as DEXes, lending and borrowing, and yield farming became the standard stack on each new chain that DeFi was being built on."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Essential Technologies", "input": "Expansion Beyond Ethereum", "output": "Development on Ethereum skyrocketed during DeFi Summer as the number of new protocols being released into the wild was massive. A group of protocols, including DEXes, lending and borrowing, and yield farming, became the standard stack on each new chain that DeFi was being built on. Ethereum’s transaction fees, called Gas, became much higher due to demand – Ethereum can only handle about 12-20 transactions per second which led to many protocols expanding beyond Ethereum. Some protocols exclusively remained on Ethereum, while others expanded to newlayer 1sthat were gaining traction.Sushi, for example, is one of the protocols that started on Ethereum and has since become available on 14 other blockchains orlayer two scaling solutions(defined below). The reasons for this vary as blockchains have different spectrums ofcapability,interoperability,scalability, anddecentralization, although many are starkly similar to Ethereum."}

Interestingly enough, this function has been used as an argument for why Ethereum is a commodity rather than a security and thus is (currently) under the purview of theCFTC(CommodityFutures Trading Commission) instead of theSEC(Securitiesand Exchange Commission). However, this is an unresolved issue. Examples:SOL,ETH,NEAR"}

They have since crept into governance, art, publishing, science, and many other industries. Peer-to-peer transactions are crypto’s oldest use case, and DeFi is a logical extension. Regarding DeFi, constant innovations are being made that enhance previous technologies and introduce new ones. The open-source nature of DeFi helps speed up innovations, and that opens doors to create new ideas and vulnerabilities. With the amount of money on-chain (as much as $250 billion at its peak), there are plenty of opportunities for bad actors to misbehave.

Before liquid staking, one of its downsides was that a staked asset was notliquid. It could not be used as collateral or traded for something else—cue liquid staking. Liquid staking is the process of obtaining a liquid I-owe-you token that is supposed to trade on parity with the underlying asset being staked. This liquid token represents the illiquid coin/token that is staked. The staking yields accrue to the liquid token and either affect the price or the number of one’s holdings – dependent on the liquid staking method involved. Examples:Lido,Marinade"}

ICOs are like IPOs (initial public offerings) in that they introduce a new market by providing liquidity to a new asset. Below is an example of how a launchpad may work.A new token is launching. To participate in the ICO, investors will have to have 100 of the launchpad’s tokens staked to the platform for the three days before the launch. There may be a fixed amount of allocations, or if there is significant investor interest, then there may be a lottery function that gives tickets for a specific amount of the new token to a select number of staked ICO participants.As with all DeFi protocols, there are many launchpads across all major blockchains, and they all vary according to how they function.

{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Advanced DeFi Technology", "input": "Bridges", "output": "Bridges connect one blockchain to another and let usersbridgeassets between the two. They are somewhat controversial because a few major hacks have occurred on bridges. After all, they are large targets. The standard bridge consists of the token being transferred from one blockchain to another, being locked up andwrapped. Moving Ethereum tokens to the Solana blockchain, for example, requires the Ethereum tokens to be wrapped and distributed as WETH for them to function on Solana. The actual ETH is still locked up within the bridge’s smart contracts and is only released upon the relinquishment/burning of the WETH. Arguments for bridges are primarily based on the idea that blockchains will scale if they’re interoperable together, meaning their assets can freely move between each other. Arguments against bridges, like those made by Ethereum’s founderVitalik Buterin, are primarily based on the idea that they’re not necessary nor safe. Examples:Portal,Swim"}

It’s full of acclaim and criticism as it varies widely in its execution. This includes the protocols that gamify DeFi mechanisms and the videogames that include digital economies built on blockchains.The idea makes sense. Suppose you buy a digital asset like a rifle skin in a centralized video game ecosystem like Call of Duty. Now imagine Call of Duty goes out of business or decides to remove that asset. You lose it with no way of ever recovering it. This is an argument for NFTs as much as it is GameFi.GameFi detractors will argue that digital sweatshops are being created where the bulk of users will naturally become places where incomes are so low that the most logical way to earn a living is to spend all their workdays playing a GameFi videogame.

{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Advanced DeFi Technology", "input": "Atomic Swaps", "output": "Atomic swaps are swaps with built-in functions that ensure two sides of a trade fulfill a series of predefined conditions before the trade is completed. This often requires a hashed timelock contract (HTLC) which provides both transactions will be reversed if both parties don’t fulfill their predetermined conditions. All of this can be done in a decentralized fashion to enable cross-chain trading without an intermediary like a bridge or an exchange needing to be involved."}

This strategy can utilize multiple open-source smart contracts to extract arbitrage or profits from inefficient protocols."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Advanced DeFi Technology", "input": "Gaming the System with Non-Standard Accounting", "output": "DeFi’s interoperable nature makes it difficult to standardize. Metrics like earnings per share (EPS) exist to a certain extent. Still, they’re often opaquely derived and don’t accurately represent the financial realities taking place – which is the point of all accounting. One metric you will see everywhere istotal value locked (TVL). TVL is a good metric for certain things within certain types of applications, but the way it’s measured matters more than anything else. It can easily be gamed to show activity or liquidity that isn’t there.ThisCoinDesk article breaks down an example of dubious developers implementing double counting mechanisms in their TVL calculation which skewed the data to misrepresent the actual amount of capital involved. It makes you wonder how many protocols are being honest about their TVL calculations when you look at DeFi Llama’s cross-chain TVL aggregation dashboard. More relevant metrics need to be standardized and used across similar types of applications to avoid more misleading accounting practices. Yield farming protocols have different architectures than decentralized fund management protocols and thus need different standardized metrics measuring different things. These different things are currently non-standard because they’re new and still being developed. As with any new technology, standardization will come with time."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Advanced DeFi Technology", "input": "Interoperable, Permissionless Futures", "output": "DeFi developers often refer to what they’re doing as buildingmoney legos. They’re referring to the interoperable, permissionless capabilities of the financial mechanisms they’re working with. These capabilities have been expanded to create new forms of yield generation and means of transferring value, as well as new financial techniques (flash loans and MEV). As DeFi technology continues to progress, so too do the number of new opportunities for both good and bad actors. It’s imperative to know how these things work behind the scenes before using them to avoid being manipulated or robbed by a bad actor. Here, I again plagiarize myself and include the tried and true meme that describes all of crypto and self-custody."}

Theoretically, a barter system could work on a small scale but can’t support global trade or commerce. For the last century, the US dollar (USD) has become the standard store of value, unit of account, and medium of exchange for the whole world.

Considering the relative position of every other country in the world, it’s easy to understand why the US is so influential in world affairs. The US has more money to spend than any other country and has the world’s most prominent military presence backing it up. While the USisn’t even closeto being the country with the most wealth inequality, 1% still owns 30% of the wealth and16x more than the bottom 50%. To support the massive amount of assets within the American financial industry, there needs to be an enormous amount of infrastructure – and there is.

Federal employees and global news pundits will cite economic theories and papers from reputable universities written about, for example –Modern Monetary Theory(MMT) – as a basis for their policy choices. MMT includes justifications for excessive money printing, which has directly aligned with the Federal Reserve’s strategy of quantitative easing and economic stimulus packages. It is strongly contested by proponents of other economic perspectives, such as theAustrianschool of economics. Finance and economics, like medicine, is a science that doesn’t require one to have a lot of knowledge to sound smart. Jargon will do just fine."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Money", "input": "Bretton Woods", "output": "The position of the US in the global economy is only 78 years old. In 1944, the US, Canada, Australia, Japan, and several western European countries convened in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, to configure a new monetary order. The US was far and away in a position of dominance since the European powers were fragile due to WW2 battles and bombings taking place on their soil. Representatives from around the world were consensually coerced into agreeing to the US’s pitch of how global monetary relations should function. The consequences of Bretton Woods were the beginning formation of many reconstruction efforts such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the US dollar) becoming the de factoreserve currencyfor US-protected global trade. This global world order has benefited billions but has caused adverse second-order effects. The financial markets and financial services industries were not exempt from such developments. As markets expanded, so did their opaqueness due to more financial intermediaries/middlepeople being introduced. Modern traditional financial practices are obsolete compared to the immutable transparency possible with blockchain technology today. Benoit Mandelbrotobserved that based on their relative ages, you can compare financenowto where chemistrywasin the 16th century from an evolutionary perspective. Since that’s the case, financial alchemy is a portion of what goes on within traditional finance. Alchemy was the pseudoscience and speculative philosophy, the medieval forerunner to modern chemistry. In other words, some of what goes on behind the scenes are not in your best interest. In the past 78 years, countries like the US, Germany, China, and Singapore have risen to become world powers, while many other economies have yet to fully develop. Economists often break the world into 3 parts –developed,emerging, andfrontier. Crypto’s role drastically differs in each, for now."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Money", "input": "Developed Markets", "output": "Crypto is indeed a bet on new technologies changing the world but for some, it’s a bet on the old world breaking with no recourse. In other words, you don’t have to think the world’s financial system will crumble if you believe in crypto but more often than not, people who do think thatalsodo believe in crypto. It’s a nuance that’s difficult to explain but makes a major difference. Suppose you peruse Twitter, Reddit, or other online threads about crypto. You’ll likely find people talking about how the USD will be debased, how BTC will become the world’s future reserve currency, or how dumb people in crypto are for thinking these things. Gold bugs have felt this way for centuries. If you’re a gold bug in a country like Argentina or Turkey, where your domestic currency experiences hyperinflation regularly, then you’re hailed as a genius. If you’re a gold bug in the US, where you can safely store your USD in a bank controlled by arm guards, then you’re a wackadoodle. When Bitcoin hit the scene in 2008, along with the enshrined headline by a British daily that read, “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on the brink of second bailout for banks” inBitcoin’s Genesis Block, it made waves. This was the first asset that was effectively un-seizable (without a$5 wrench)and from its very first moment, it absorbed and created the underlying counterculture to traditional finance. Because of the complicated nature of developed markets, developed financial systems are bureaucratic and, on the whole, challenging to change. Both the obsolete and practical assortments of systems that have been in place for decades are generally skeptical when it comes to change. It’s perfectly natural for large systems to reject change as it is essentially a threat to the market participants within the prevailing system. Unless the US financial system fails, outright alternatives like DeFi will likely remain a fringe activity for the foreseeable future. There will probably be DeFi integrations across many sectors within the US economy, but in terms of a total overhaul of the payment rails for the whole world, that’s quite the uphill battle.Even if the dollar went to zero tomorrow, there are still trillions in American real estate, intellectual property, weapons, and physical goods that underly the US economy. These assets would still have value; they would need to be valued in a new currency.For these reasons and many more, DeFi’s most considerable impacts will likely be felt within the emerging and frontier markets."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Money", "input": "Emerging & Frontier Markets", "output": "While the US financial system may be slow, skeptical, or biased regarding adopting blockchain technology and decentralized finance (DeFi), emerging and frontier markets won’t have to operate with those same restrictions. It’s in these regions where DeFi is already proving its use case, although more of the world who need it is not using it. For those who do, it’s the only option to properly utilize money’s 3 value propositions. Without a stable mechanism like the USD to perform those duties, individuals and corporations are subject to volatile fluctuations of their assets and net worth, which prevent an economy from functioning correctly. According to the US Federal Reserve, the US had22%of its adults unbanked or underbanked in 2019. That’s 63 million people in the wealthiest country in the world without access to adequate financial services. The rest of the world is even more underbanked and less financially literate. Unbanked– Not having or never having savings, checking, or another account with a bank. Underbanked– Having inadequate access to financial services and banking facilities. Anyone who is unbanked or underbanked cannot partake in earning interest on deposits, investing in the stock market, paying bills online, purchasing goods or services over the internet, accessing credit, or several other valuable financial activities. Without standard banking, there is also the need to use alternative financial services likemoney ordersand prepaid cards, which are inefficient and rack up fees."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Money", "input": "DeFi’s Role", "output": "While banking could be a better system, no doubt using a good one gives an individual more financial freedom and ability when compared to being unbanked. The problem is that not all banks are good ones, and not all currencies reliably fulfill the three functions of money. While DeFidoesseek to provide banking and investment services to its users, it does sowithoutthe need for banks or investment firms. The only way to do this is to not trust a counter-party. Not wanting to trust a counter-party may sound counter-intuitive, butif there is no counter-party, then there is no counter-party risk.If there are no ethics, there is no misbehavior. It’s a technical philosophy embodied in the code behind decentralized systems, and it’s all possible because of the underlying consensus methods that enable blockchains to operate. Consensusmethodsarealgorithmsthat an incentivized computer network uses to participate in collective transaction verification. The process of how this works varies from method to method. Because ofimmutable,interoperable,capable, andpermissionlessblockchains, DeFi can operate in ways that weren’t possible before. Its ambitions span that of enhancing developed financial markets and building the economic infrastructure for emerging and frontier ones. Among many goals, it seeks to onboard fiat currencies to the burgeoning digital blockchain economies through globally transferable stablecoins. Solana alone has already transferred over $300 trillion worth of value on-chain at the time of writing. This would be a huge first step for emerging and frontier economies that deal with volatile domestic currencies and interest rates. DeFi also serves as the bedrock underpinning the NFT, DAO, and Web3 movements."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Money", "input": "Opportunities to Enhance and Rebuild", "output": "When compared to what the established financial industries have to offer, DeFi presents alternatives that are opportunities to rebuild and enhance obsolete or convoluted processes and technologies. While blockchain detractors claim it’s a solution looking for a problem, blockchain proponents understand that blockchains can address many real-world use cases that cannot be or have not been handled with incumbent systems. DeFi, unlike Bitcoin, is not an argument for a new reserve currency. It’s an argument for a new form of digital commerce."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Consensus Methods", "input": "Consensus Methods", "output": "Consensus methods enable networks to decentralize. These methods are algorithms embedded into the code that allows verified networks of computers to participate in blockchain transactions. They are the absolute cornerstone of every blockchain, and they incentivizeminersorvalidatorsto verify transactions while at the same time making it too expensive to take control of the entire network. If one miner or validator overtakes the network, they could re-write history and front-run any transaction. Generally, the more computers there are mining or validating blocks of transactions, the more secure the network is. There are dozens of consensus methods with which blockchains verify and settle transactions, each with its own tradeoffs. Blockchains have attributes that, when addressed, make other attributes problematic. Ethereum’s co-founder,Vitalik Buterin, has clarified this concept with the idea of theBlockchain Trilemma. It is a set of three issues –decentralization,security, andscalability– which require sacrifices of one for the sake of the others. There are plenty of arguments over which is the most secure consensus method. Still, it’s important to remember that crypto is a hyper-evolving technology that, in many cases, can be considered unproven. There are proven aspects of the technology, but that doesn’t mean another technology can’t come in and make it all obsolete. Some skeptics even think quantum computing will make the cryptography behind cryptocurrency obsolete, but that is entirely hypothetical. The alternate take is that the security measures behind it evolve alongside advances in technologies like quantum computing."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Consensus Methods", "input": "It’s all Behind the Scenes", "output": "By far, the most important and widespread consensus methods areProof of Work(Bitcoin, Hathor),Proof of Stake(Ethereum, Avalanche, Near, IBC chains), andProof of History(Solana). We’ll break down each of these below. Most chains utilize Proof of Stake to some capacity, although many operate with variations or hybrids of the above. To make it even more confusing, Ethereum is switching from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS), and Solana is a hybrid of PoS and PoW. Ultimately, the vision is for blockchains to operate as an enhanced version of the internet. You won’t need to understand what consensus method is going on behind the scenes of your favorite NFT or DeFi protocol in the same way that you don’t need to understand theTCP/IPandHTTPprotocols behind the scenes of every website on the internet."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Consensus Methods", "input": "Proof of Work (PoW)", "output": "When using a Proof of Work consensus method,the computers that verify transactions must compute highly complex math problems. These computers are calledMiners. Transactions are recorded in a sequential series of blocks that are constantly updated as more transactions are mined. This method prevents users from double spending the same cryptocurrency as every miner can see every transaction made up to the present moment. Mining is an energy-intensive process that requires more energy the more miners are involved. The math problems these miners have to solve become more complex as more miners join the network – thus requiring more energy to be expended. The same is true in the opposite direction. When a Miner has mined a block of transactions (verified them as being true and distributed that truth across the entire miner network), they are rewarded with a token. In the case of the Bitcoin blockchain, miners are rewarded with Bitcoin. The reward size decreases over time, thus introducing more scarcity into the network. An entire overhaul of Bitcoin’s source code would need to be implemented for the total number of Bitcoins to change. Many checks and balances are intended to make changing the code a challenging and arduous process, which would require thousands of developers to agree on issues that have caused previous developers to go out and start their own blockchains. It’s unlikely, but it is possible. The culture surrounding Bitcoin is another roadblock, as Bitcoiners are typically against implementing changes to the protocol. The last of the 21 million Bitcoin is projected to be mined around 2140.It’s up to speculators to estimate how the network will work after all the coins have been excavated – some claim it will be done solely with transaction fees being rewarded to miners. We’ll see (or our grandkids will)."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Consensus Methods", "input": "Hashrate", "output": "The difficulty of the math problems is calculated by Bitcoin’shashrate. The hashrate measures the combined computational power being used to mine Bitcoin. In 2019, China accounted for over 75% of the global hashrate. This meant roughly 75% of Bitcoin mining was taking place in China. In 2021, China banned the holding and mining of cryptocurrencies, and all the Chinese miners were forced to shut down or move operations to a different country. Because of this dramatic event, the hashrate declined. As shown in the diagram above, the hashrate has since improved and reached all-time highs. Many miners moved to the US, which has positioned the US as one of the top locations for Bitcoin miners in the world. It needs to be clarified if this was anticipated by the Chinese government or was an unintended consequence. This hashrate rally occurred during a multi-month drawdown on Bitcoin’s price, so it is clearly not a representation of pricing but rather a representation of the network’s security."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Consensus Methods", "input": "Proof of Stake (PoS)", "output": "Ethereum and Solana utilizeProof of Stake, although Solana is technically a hybrid Proof of Stake andProof of History(PoH) network. The computers verifying transactions on a Proof of Stake network are calledvalidators. These validators are not performing the complicated math to earn rewards but instead proving themselves as network participants with largestakesin the network. Individual stakers choose todelegatetokens to a validator on the network of that token and are rewarded with a share of the validator’s rewards. Stakers delegate to validators based on criteria like their reward share, uptime, and reputation. If you’re staking SOL, you’re doing so through a SOL validator and helping secure the Solana network. 💡 The more validators or miners involved in a blockchain, the better. If a validator has too much sway on the network, they can change the ledger’s history and cause mayhem. To help prevent that from happening on Solana, Solflare has implemented Marinade Finance’s liquid staking product, which delegates SOL to a network of over 450 validators, effectively securing the decentralization of the Solana network. Given that Solflare has facilitated over 25% of SOL staking (roughly $30 billion worth at its peak), this partnership with Marinade is rather significant. Bitcoin is the primary blockchain that utilizes PoW and is somewhat its own. Most of the other top blockchains use PoS or variations of it."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Consensus Methods", "input": "Proof of History", "output": "Solana has introduced several novel innovations, namelyProof of History. Proof of History is a mechanism that enables Solana validators to measure time in a new way, allowing them to process transactions at unprecedented speeds. The speed and efficiency of Solana can not be overstated. Proof of History implements a clock that allows validators and the network to tell time without relying on any trusted source. The clock does not measure absolute time frames as a regular atomic clock but rather the relative distance between events and transactions. This enables a standardization that is impossible elsewhere and allows the network to validate information exceptionally quickly. For a more thorough understanding of the potential of PoH and how it works, readthis articlewritten bySolana’s CEOon Solana.com and in Solflare’s Knowledge Base."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Consensus Methods", "input": "Transaction Speed & Throughput", "output": "Throughput refers to how many actions are completed in a window of time. Different blockchains form for different reasons and have vastly different speeds and throughputs. Bitcoin was formed to be a peer-to-peer method of exchange but has since become digital gold. Ethereum was formed to be aninfinite machine. Solana was developed to be the fastest and most scalable medium to recordstate changes. Bitcoin can handle anywhere from 5-10 transactions per second (tps). Ethereum can handle about 10-30 depending on network congestion, but as many of you know – it can be pretty costly. Solana, on the other hand, can handle roughly 65,000 tps, which will theoretically increase as computing power increases. It regularly handles between 2,000-6,000 tps at the time of writing. Fees are also a fraction of a penny on Solana, while Ethereum fees can range from $5-200 for simple transactions. For some perspective, Visa and Mastercard – centralized entities with closed ecosystems – can handle about 50,000 transactions per second at their peak volumes and charge vendors anywhere from 1-4% per transaction. This isn’t even accounting for exchange fees when a charge is being made outside the country from which the card came. That is all well and good for Visa and Mastercard, but Solana can do the same while being anInteroperableandImmutable open systemwith far lower fees. It’s an upgrade to traditional payment rails."}

Some are built for modularity, and some are made to be monolithic. As mentioned in the first few paragraphs of this chapter, blockchains and cryptocurrencies are hyper-evolving experiments. The goals and vision of blockchains differ as much as the technology does, and there are endless arguments on the validity and security of different consensus methods. As a result,new blockchains are popping up every year. Much of this course includes topics that could be a course in itself. Consensus methods could bemanycourses. It’s a vast topic relevant to developers, entrepreneurs, and investors alike. If you want to invest in or build something on a blockchain, you need to know what’s possible – andconsensus methods make it all possible."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: NFTs & DAOs", "input": "NFTs", "output": "An NFT is a non-fungible token worth some amount of (a) fungible token(s).NFTs are complicated, wide-ranging, and severely misunderstood regarding their potential. They’re traded on-chain, so NFT markets are open 24/7. While most of what you regard as an NFT will likely be worthless in due time, there can be massive amounts of inherent value when designed with utility in mind. NFTs can represent both digital and real-life objects. Owning an NFT worth $10,000 can be much more powerful than holding $10,000, but it is not easy to explain why if you need help understanding how blockchains work. NFTs can represent basically anything, such as the ownership of areal-world asset,music royalties,socks,art,in-game items, and evensophisticated DeFi mechanisms. Anyone with an NFT can be airdropped future tokens and NFTs. NFTs can give you special access to a concert or any live event. They can be static profile photos, they can be generative gifs, and they can even be the deed to your house. The opportunities are virtually and physically limitless. Think of the NFTs you own as the digital version of your belongings on display in your house. Art on the walls, a collection of your favorite artists’ CDs, posters of memorable past events, etc. Instead of this collection of belongings’ visibility being limited to visitors in your home, anyone can view your digital NFT gallery to get a sense of your interests, hobbies, and cherished items. LikeVincent Van Dough’smulti-million dollar virtual studio below, you can also make customized 3D and VR-accessible museums for your collections."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: NFTs & DAOs", "input": "Symbiosis", "output": "When an investor buys an NFT, the NFT is automatically deposited into their wallet, and depending on the exchange, the funds should be automatically deposited into a creator’s wallet. The investor is buying the NFT because they see value in holding it. This permission-less value transfer from creators to investors is not one way. Creators get to set a royalty rate on their NFTs, which often ranges from 1-5%. If the rate were 5%, then the NFT creator would automatically receive 5% of every secondary sale. No ifs, and, or buts. The code behind the autonomous smart contracts involved is in charge. It’s a bit different than Apple’s 30% take rate on every sale of anything within the app store. This capability was impossible a decade ago, and it is a game-changer for creator economies like video games, digital art, music, and film. Think about the ramifications for an incumbent industry withanyform of cash flow. Royalties generated from an NFT project can be funneled into a community treasury governed by a DAO of people who own the NFTs from said project. How do you gain access to the DAO?

In short, it is a mentality and framework for how the internet should evolve. A full description of web 3 is out of the scope of this course but feel free to check out the articles breaking downWeb 1,Web 2, andWeb 3on Solflare’s Knowledge Base. Many conventional web 2 creators and engineers have a significant amount of vitriol for what’s being called web 3. Web 3 has become quite thebuzzword, althoughit’s simply a function and philosophy for how the open internet should operate. It’s closer to the vision that early internet developers had when compared to what the internet has turned out to be – a few walled gardens full of user-generated content.Web 3’s ideal framework is user-owned networks. Regarding the creator economy, the new multi-chain toolset that is beginning to enable user-owned networks issurreallyunderrated in the mainstream.

Imagine an NFT framework for a residential investment property, an ice cream store, or a Bruno Mars song. Any cash flow can be tokenized, fractionalized, and distributed via NFTs.It’s similar to horse syndication in professional horse racing, but it can be applied to nearly any asset class. NFTs are poised to flip the creator economy on its head by giving individuals access to innovative community and fundraising opportunities while doing so in this new permission-less world of DeFi, NFTs, and DAOs.

Alongside using them as collateral, NFTs themselves can be fractionalized. Fractionalized.iois an exchange where users can choose how much of an NFT they want to sell and for what price. The impact fractionalization has on NFT-gated DAOs is determinable on a case-by-case basis. Just for fun There is even a project where a photo of the Shiba Inu dog was turned into an NFT, fractionalized, and used as collateral backing a new cryptocurrency:DOG. OK, now on to DAOs."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: NFTs & DAOs", "input": "DAOs", "output": "DAOs have been around for quite some time. They stand forDecentralized Autonomous Organizationsand are a de facto standard for how many crypto protocols operate. The first DAO references began popping up in the early 90s, although they only became a reality in the mid-2010s. In the early days of Bitcoin, crypto enthusiasts would attempt to build proto-DAOs called DACs – Decentralized Autonomous Corporations. These DACs slowly evaporated as there was no sustainable platform for them to operate on in the way the enthusiasts envisioned. Once Ethereum was live, DAOs emerged.The early formations of DACs and DAOs strongly believed that code is the law. Although that sentiment has since diminished because of the abundantly clear fact thatcode is fallible, the belief still permeates through operational procedures within DAOs asmost activity occurs on-chain or through a series of smart contracts. Above is a screenshot of DeepDAO’s analytical dashboard breaking down recent DAO statistics. With over 4,000 organizations, $10 billion across treasuries, and 1.8 million unique governance token holders, DAOs look like they’re here to stay."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: NFTs & DAOs", "input": "Case Study", "output": "If you transact on Uniswap, Ethereum’s largest DEX, you pay the transaction fee in ETH. So what’s the UNI token for? The short answer is governance. The Uniswap protocol earns fees automatically deposited into a treasury which is then governed by UNI holders via components of the smart contracts involved. There are no intermediaries escrowing funds or charging excessive fees.It is simply people interacting with a decentralized protocol on a decentralized blockchain.Recently, Uniswap’s trading volume eclipsed that of Coinbase. Due to smart contract programming, a portion of all the transaction fees is automatically deposited into the Uniswap Treasury wallet. This treasury now holds over $2,600,000,000 at current prices. Who decides what is done with this money? UNI holders. UNI holders vote on proposals for what is done with the treasury. 1 UNI = 1 vote. There are issues with this model, such as the idea that a rich person or company could come in and buy all the tokens to domineer governance decisions. Many alternative models are constantly being iterated on, so if you don’t like the DAO you’re in, join another one."}

You’ll see the letters D A O imprinted all over the place, and sometimes it makes more sense than others. The effectiveness of DAOs is up for debate on the whole. However, there are numerous examples of successful implementations and people making a living in the pseudonymous economy by contributing to one or more DAOs from ananonaccount. Ananonymous account is technically a pseudonymous account where someone communicates with the DAO as an unknown entity."}

It has been used at great length to discuss issues with DeFi and Web3. Token-based governance is a reasonably skeuomorphic concept because TradFi systems already enable corporate governance via share ownership. The difference that DAOs offer is these tokens exist on-chain in an inherently composable and transparent nature compared to TradFi, where equity shares have many inhibiting features, and significant decisions are made behind closed doors. This concept of composability means that these tokens can be utilized in many shapes and sizes, such as a form of voting rights in a DAO or collateral in a DeFi project. Some votes are worth more than others, and token-gated DAOs constantly evolve. You can even send on-chain bribes. Say you wanted to influence the decision of a UNI whale. Well, you could send over some ETH or USDC and try to convince them. This opens a discussion of tokenomics that we won’t get into here but know that a lot is going on out there. The topic of composability has become the backbone of much of the DeFi, NFT, and DAO worlds."}

They are like private bank accounts built on a blockchain, consisting of 3 primary mechanisms –public keys,private keys, andmnemonics. You can connect to crypto applications likeSolriseandMagic Edenwith your wallet; no intermediary is ever between you and your assets. You’re in complete control."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Self Custody: Part 1", "input": "Benefits of Non-Custodial Wallets", "output": "The short answer: Traditional custodial methods for asset management always require at least one counterparty, like a bank. A non-custodial wallet enables you to custody your assets withoutanycounterparty. The long answer: Decentralized networks only make sense if the assets on them are also decentralized. If blockchains operated in a decentralized fashion while wallets operated using centralized counterparties, all the benefits of the blockchain would vanish, and the same problems in centralized finance would exist in decentralized finance."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Self Custody: Part 1", "input": "Real-World Use Case", "output": "Non-custodial wallets are ground-breaking and enable digital economies to exist in ways unlike ever before. Their significance can be difficult to convey, so let’s start with a tangible real-world example. When migrant workers acquire a visa to work in foreign countries and send back money to their families back home, they send what’s called aremittance. This is usually done throughWestern Unionor some large bank that has branches all over the world. Low-income country remittances amounted to $466 billion in 2017. Globally, fees averaged 7.45%, or $34.7 billion. $7.45% equates to over 27 days of an average worker’s annual income, meaning low-incomemigrantworkers spent 27 days’ worth of their 2017 salary to send money back home. To put the absolute dollar value of these fees into perspective, the US’s non-military foreign aid budget in 2017 was$34 billion. Non-custodial wallets present an alternative solution by enabling permissionless, global capital transfers.If blockchains or blockchain wallets werecustodial, the counterparty could stop transactions from happening and require all remittances to be paid throughWestern Union.

Like using the internet today, you won’t need to understand what’s happening under the hood to securely custody your assets. You’ll need to understand the basics –public, private, andmnemonics. Let’s start with public keys."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Self Custody: Part 1", "input": "Public Keys", "output": "Public keys are wallet addresses. Think of them as your email address. You can send emails to any email address at any time. In the same way, you can send digital assets to any wallet’s address at any time – as long as the blockchain you’re on is not compromised. Public keys are intimidating if you’re new to them, but you can copy and paste them when necessary. This one-time copy and pasting are recommended in crypto, as copying and pasting a private key or mnemonic can result in a hacker obtaining it. There are several operational security practices you’ll have to undertake to properly self custody your assets. Each character of thewallet address / public keyis connected to your private key, and if you send digital assets to the wrong wallet address, you will likely be unable to recover them. This issue is continually being addressed by wallet designers. If these long alphanumerics are overly intimidating, there’s always the option to utilize acustodial walletat a centralized crypto exchange (likeFTXorCoinbase) rather than a non-custodial one (likeSolflareorMetamask). Many wallets have built-in address books, so you won’t need to copy and paste a public key every time. Most mainstream crypto exchanges also support this feature. The risk of utilizing a non-custodial wallet is either losing your private key, mnemonic/recovery phraseor stealing it.Keeping a copy of each of those written down and stored safely is crucial.Some people etch it into fireproof, “bullet-proof” steel. Only take a video for social media and accidentally leave your phrase visible in the background. Don’t click on any suspicious-looking links – they could bephishing attemptsthat could drain your wallet. This happened toSeth Green, who played Dr. Evil in the movie trilogy Austin Powers. Also,don’t take screenshots of your recovery phrase or private key.

A private key is an alphanumeric string of characters that gives you access to your wallet. Think of a private key as a randomly generated password for a specific account that you access with a master password technology likeNordPassorLast Pass. The master password, in this case, would be your mnemonic phrase. You won’t need to remember your private key and will likely never need to use it. It is, however, a vitally important string of characters.Access to your private key (via your recovery phrase) is necessary to access your funds."}

In short, your mnemonic gives you access to your private key, which provides you with access to your funds. From the user’s perspective,Mnemonics / Recovery Phrases / Seed Phrasesare the most essential aspect of a wallet. They are the human-readable sequences of words that give you access to your private keys and, thus, your capital. The words are generally in English, although there are many languages wallet providers can choose to implement. A public key can easily be calculated from a private key; however, computing the private key from a public key is impossible. Most people are blissfully unaware of their private key(s), which is fine … as long as they arepainfully awareof their mnemonic. To be clear, a mnemonic isnota private key, although if someone were to obtain either your mnemonicoryour private key, your digital assets would be compromised. As mentioned above, think of your mnemonic as the master password to a password management system. All the passwords you are storing in the system would be your private keys in this analogy. Some wallets also utilize an existing password. Passwords are not that big of a deal. They are primarily there for convenience, so you don’t have to input your mnemonic phrase whenever you want to access your funds. If you forget your password, you can just reset it with your mnemonic phrase. No email, phone, or 2-factor authentication methods are required!"}

The possibility of this event results fromfractional reserve lending, which enables banks to only hold a portion of your deposit on hand. At the same time, they lend the rest out to other customers. In 1910, after helping bail out a particularly bad bank run, Chase Bank’s founder,J.P Morgan, and other high-ranking bankers secretly secluded themselves for 10 days to figure out how they could enhance the American banking system. This plan came to fruition 3 years later in the form of the Federal Reserve, a singular central bank for the USA. The FED can be considered a hybrid or different faction within the US government. It’s part of the US governmental purview, but it doesn’tnecessarilyhave to listen to congress. Congress enactsfiscalpolicy, such as raising and loweringtaxrates, while central banks, like the FED, enactmonetarypolicy, such as raising and loweringinterestrates. The two are often in cahoots. As the US gained a larger share of global dominance after the two World Wars, the FED’s macroeconomic role only gained prominence. Since the chart-breaking inflation metrics of the 1970s, the FED has generally enacted anexpansionarymonetary policy (in contrast to acontractionaryone) in the form of lowering interest rates. Think about interest rates as the cost of borrowing money. Dropping them effectively lets individuals and businesses take more risks. As interest rates have declined, even to the negative in many parts of the world, asset prices have skyrocketed. This is because businesses can borrow more money, invest in more projects, and say their future value will be even higher. For more context, stock markets are valued onfuturecash flows.

{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: A Bird’s Eye View", "input": "DeFi Doubters", "output": "F. Scott Fitzgerald There are generally 2 types of DeFi doubters: A more thoughtful approach to crypto and DeFi is to beskeptically optimistic. With any new technology, there will be disruption, and not all of it will always be good. The primary problem in blockchain-related technology is that most people need help understanding it. It’s easy to get scammed when you don’t know what you’re doing, and it’s easy to trust a snake oil salesperson if you think they know what they’re talking about. As is the case with the medical and scientific fields, it doesn’t take a lot of knowledge in crypto to sound like you know what you’re talking about. Until the average user learns what they need to know or until crypto applications’ UI/UX flows reinforce all they need to know in their users’ mindsets, crypto will remain a wild west to the uninformed. While it’s better to be an optimistic skeptic, it’s all well and good to be a DeFi Doubter, but what’s the alternative? A continuation of opaque market procedures, unsustainable monetary policy, and hyper-inflationary events of debased fiat currencies becoming the norm? The world is trending in a populist, deglobalizing direction, likely bringing about continued fiscal and monetary looseness. The plan is to tame inflation (9.1%in the US as of June 2022) by increasing interest rates over the next few years. As an asset class, Crypto has never experienced a prolonged environment of rising interest rates, so it will be interesting to see how prices react. However, there is a solid case to be made that interest rates will stay elevated for a while. Below is a chart of the last 700 years of interest rates across the globe. As the US proceeds to decouple itself from its previous role of international protector and, in some cases – aggressor in exchange for a more isolationist position, free global trade will struggle to sustain the exponential growth it’s experienced over the past 50-70 years. Alongside broken supply chains, uprising political conflicts, and currency debasements, politicians and central bankers will have no choice but to enact a populist fiscal policy (low taxes & high spending) and a liberal monetary policy (low-interest rates & potentially quantitative easing &yield curve control). All of this means that fiat money will continue to devalue over time. For now, USD is accruing more value as the world outside of the US struggles to find or create worthy alternatives, but is that sustainable? The chart below shows how much the value of $1 has declined from 1913 to 2013. TL;DRIn today’s terms, $1 in 1900 was equivalent to $26.14 in 2020, implying a decrease in buying power of 96.2%. Remember, when assets go down 90+% in value, that never means they can’t do the same thing again. So, where does DeFi come in? It varies. If you’re in one of the wealthier countries in the world, you may utilize DeFi as an alternative investment class. Still, for those in less financially secure countries, you may be using DeFi because you don’t have any other option."}

The Turkish Lira experienced a reported 78% inflation from 2021-2022. So your $100 worth of TRL is roughly $22 if the bank gives you back your deposit. This type of heartache used to be unavoidable for the global middle and lower classes, but now there’s an alternative. Instead of using a soon-to-be-defunct domestic bank in a country with a falling currency, you can open a non-custodial wallet like Solflare and securely store an infinite amount of digital assets. This wallet isn’t physical. You can bring it across borders by remembering your recovery phrase or keeping a copy of your private key. Operational security risks and other nuances need to be considered, but this example gives you an idea of what’s possible. How easy is it to withdraw $25,000 from your bank? How easy is it to travel across violent borders with that $25,000 – especially if that $25,000 worth of value is in another currency other than the USD. The answers are all that it is exceedingly difficult to do so without DeFi. Real estate debt levels and nationalized industry have taken a toll on the Chinese banking system, and some banks have already censored withdrawals. Chinese authorities recently switched some citizen health codes fromCovid negative to positive(which effectively banned them from all public venues and transport systems) to prevent them from withdrawing from their bank. In May of 2022, it was reported that nearly1 millionChinese customers were unable to withdraw money from bank accounts. Thentanks were deployedon the protesters who had their funds frozen. Regarding centralization and censorship, China is extreme, but the world operates on a spectrum. The need for DeFi also operates on that spectrum. Crypto has been iterating on its forms of yield generation for some time. Some of it is a positive byproduct of the tools used within DeFi, and some of the more centralized versions of it, likeCelsius, are nothing but loosely regulated, falsely marketed, over-leveraged degeneracy. Using liquidity pools is one example of genuine yield generation that cuts out the middle man and gives regular people a chance to profit from their digital assets. For a complete primer on them, check out the article below. Traditional financial markets require market makers. Market makers are specialized traders who provide liquidity to a market. There are good and bad effects, side effects, and second-order effects resulting from this infrastructure, and one of the outcomes is the vast majority of traders lose money. Through the use of precise algorithms,Automated Market Makers(AMMs) effectively replace market makers for both volatile assets (ETH for BTC or ETH for USD) and stable assets (USDC for USDT or ETH for wETH). As described in Chapter 3, AMMs are algorithms programmed atop a blockchain that let you trade one digital asset for another using a pool of funds and a pricing mechanism. Liquidity providers are usually paid in one of two ways – with a share of the trading fees or an incentivized liquidity allocation. Incentivized liquidity allocations (liquidity mining campaigns) are unsustainable but extending a percentage of trading fees to liquidity providers is not. Below is a list of the top 57-Day Average Feesmetrics DEXes across various blockchains. The fee model for nearly all these DEXes is a variation of “Trading fees are paid by traders to liquidity providers.” This is a prime example of democratized access to a yield that was gaited and exclusively available to market makers in a TradFi framework. Utilizing AMMs also makes financial services more transparent as the entire convolutedtrade life cycleis simplified as it’s all settled on a public blockchain. No morepayment for order flow! Ryan Selkis, the CEO ofMessari, recently published a thread of “35” use cases for which you can use DeFi. It’s worth a scroll."}

Unfortunately, security is often secondary to user experience, especially for demographics less impacted by the most severe drawbacks of centralized financial systems.Depending on how regulation goes over the next decade, you may see the custodial wallet model grow more than the alternative."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Self Custody: Part 2", "input": "Custodial Wallets and Services", "output": "While non-custodial wallets are much more powerful than custodial wallets, custodial wallets are definitely getting better. Some crypto exchanges are beginning to offer exposure and interoperability through DeFi products, a growing part of the industry to watch out for. This is primarily throughEarnandStakeproducts which generally incorporate traditional lending or sometimes modern DeFi strategies on the backend. DeFi is essentially not allowed in the US, and BlockFi had to pay$100 million in penaltiesbecause it failed to adhere to specific compliance disclosures. Whoops."}

Bitcoin – BTC; Avalanche – AVAX; Algorand – ALGO; etc."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: DeFi", "input": "Tokens", "output": "Tokensare smart contracts that are deployed on top of a blockchain.They refer to fungible and non-fungible tokens, which can be confusing, especially considering that they function differently than coins. Smart contracts are self-operating assortments of code that can run on blockchains without human interaction. Everything described below is possible because of smart contracts. A token’s programmable nature gives it qualities that have not existed before and can serve all sorts of new purposes."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: DeFi", "input": "Smart Contracts", "output": "The fungibility and non-fungibility of any token are encoded into asmart contract, which is simply a program deployed on a blockchain. Various software standards have been implemented that classify tokens and their functions, such asERC20for fungible Ethereum tokens and theSPL standardsfor Solana tokens. These standards make it easy to create new tokens, and DEXes make it easy to trade them. If you can encode a token’s fungible and non-fungible nature into its program, what else can you encode? Well, this is where it gets interesting."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: DeFi", "input": "Tokenomics", "output": "An entire field of crypto has sprouted alongside the development of cryptocurrencies. This field, known asTokenomics, is the study of cryptocurrency’s economic feasibility and utility. Investors will research a token’s tokenomics to see if there are any events they should be wary of, such as team vesting schedules or communityairdropswhich may affect the value of the individual tokens themselves by putting more of that token into circulation. Some founders and entrepreneurs utilize tokenomics from a more experimental point of view. They try to learn from past tokens’ mistakes and implement a framework that leads to a healthy valuation and growth life cycle for whatever they are working on. So be cautious of the tokenomics of any new token you invest in. A cryptocurrency’s tokenomics can change; if you want an idea of how complicated it can get, readthis."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: DeFi", "input": "Stable Coins", "output": "Stablecoins are one of the highest-priority issues in the regulatory landscape. They are intended to retain a peg to another asset, such as a USD. The biggest stablecoins in the world are USDT and USDC, amounting to roughly $100 billion in combined value. Each of these coins is intended to be worth $1 at all times and enable all the benefits blockchains to offer. There are three primary types of stablecoins. There are other stable coins out there, but the majority fall into one of the above categories and are tied to 1 USD. Sure, you could tie a stablecoin to 2 USD or 1,000,000 USD. You could make a new cryptocurrency, call it PIE, and peg it to $3.1415926535 – although the ticker PIE is already taken. There are stable coins pegged to the EUR, AUD, etc., but most of the volume and use cases involve USD-based stablecoins."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: DeFi", "input": "DeFi", "output": "Decentralized Finance (DeFi) highlights the difference betweenowningandpossessingsomething. In traditional finance (TradFi),you are trusting intermediaries to do right by you every step of the way. Here are some examples of that: In most parts of the world, this trust is taken for granted. This level of trust is too much in the other parts of the world that have experiencedcurrency failuresanduncapped business and banking corruption. Even in developed financial economies, this trust becomes a liability. If dirt hits the fan, do you trust your exchange to let you withdraw your money? DeFi has a tumultuous and weathered history but is now a massive hundred-billion-dollar market with room to grow. TradFi markets are worth hundreds of trillions."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: DeFi", "input": "Price Action", "output": "Crypto began as a single blockchain and a single currency. As several projects likeMasterCoinandColoredCoinspopped up, Ethereum became the only one with staying power. Ethereum paved the way for decentralized projects to bootstrap their funding rounds by issuing tokens in their 2014 ICO (Initial Coin Offering), which led to the ICO mania of 2017. Much has been documented about this time period as it was rife with scams and bewitching celebrities attempting cash grabs while the price of Ethereum soared to nearly $1500 and Bitcoin to almost $20,000. In the following years, Ethereum would crash to less than $100, and Bitcoin would fall to $3200 during the Covid drop in March 2020. Then it was up only, down only, then up only, and now down only again. The macroeconomic environment is continually finding itself in unprecedented territory, so it will be interesting to see how Bitcoin’s price and the cryptocurrency market react in the upcoming decades. Again, crypto is barely a teenager and has many uphill battles."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: DeFi", "input": "DeFi Summer & The Standard Stack", "output": "As Bitcoin and Ethereum recovered during the remainder of 2020 after the Covid drop in March, something known as DeFi Summer took off. This was a movement being built in the background since 2017. Protocols like Uniswap, MakerDAO, Curve, Yearn, and Aave took off on Ethereum, and these protocols enabled the world’s first decentralized markets for lending, borrowing, and trading. Millions and billions of dollars poured into these protocols and other applications. This period was rampant with innovation and, at the same time, speculation. Prices were rising at unsustainable rates, and some protocols were failing while their tokens were going to zero. DeFi protocols like the ones listed above – with some staying power – have inspired thousands of blockchain applications to be built across dozens of blockchains. There is a group of financial services that DeFi protocols inhabit that are mirrored on one new blockchain after the next.They have become the standard stack.Without the basic DeFi layer, blockchains are considered to be lacking. This is why you’ll see so many protocols that do the same thing on different blockchains. Oddly enough, Bitcoin does not have a developed DeFi network. Although possible, the code is not built to foster DeFi, and the development community surrounding Bitcoin is not keen on enabling it."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: DeFi", "input": "Case Study", "output": "To truly understand crypto, you need to participate in on-chain transactions. Let’s compare aspects of the trade process at ETrade, one of the world’s largest centralized exchanges (CEX), vs.Jupiter Aggregator, Solana’s most advanced decentralized exchange (DEX). It’s not just a DEX. Jupiter is an aggregator of different DEXes. If you submit a trade and Jupiter finds two options for how to do it, you’ll be presented with the option that gives you a better deal."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: DeFi", "input": "ETrade", "output": "Even just opening an account at ETrade involves jumping over some hurdles. To understand this full breakdown, you need to know what it means to belongandshort.It’s weird phrasing if you’re unfamiliar, butbeing short means you make money when the prices go down, and being long means you make money when prices go up. Here’s the unabridged process for funding an account on a CEX. The above processes do not even consider the number of centralized entities involved. The centralized exchange has a centralized custodian who possesses all of the stocks and options that people own. The centralized market makers have a much more in-depth understanding of current market conditions because they are privy to every single order. Etc. Market makers are known to play games. Below is an example of that. The market maker sells you the 100 shares but not before buying 10 puts that represent a 10x exposure of being short to your 1x exposure of being long (a put = exposure to 100 shares of being short Apple). FYI, if they sell you 100 shares of Apple, they are technically short 100 shares, and buying 10 puts makes them long 900 shares. The centralized exchanges often sell order flowin a business model called payment for order flow –PFOF, to market makers in exchange for the market makers to make markets. This is counterintuitive as it makes the information asymmetry already present in finance that much more dramatic. PFOF is the reason you can trade without commissions. As is the case across much of the traditional internet,if you use a free product – it’s actuallyyouwho is the product. Unlike TradFi, no default intermediary safeguards your funds in DeFi, and there are no traditional market makers. There areautomated market makers (AMMs), the blockchain mechanisms that underlay DEXes."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: DeFi", "input": "Jupiter Aggregator", "output": "If you want to open an investment account on a blockchain, you would be opening the same account you need to operate on the blockchain in the first place – a non-custodial digital wallet – likeSolflare. Sure, some fintech institutions are beginning to run like this, but it’s not the same. These fintech institutions can freeze your funds or delete your account anytime. Blockchains can’t do that. You can only lose access to your funds if you lose access to your mnemonic or if you position yourself to be hacked by clicking on fraudulent phishing links or telling someone your mnemonic. Let’s open an account on Jupiter. Boom. Done. Let’s make a trade on Jupiter. Boom. Done. There is no counterparty dependence. You’re not trusting anything other than the open-source code backing the Jupiter Aggregator and the underlying blockchain itself. This trade would not be sent to a centralized market maker who will play games with you. Instead, it is being sent to an AMM utilizing aliquidity pool. In short, liquidity pools are decentralized funds from individualLiquidity Providers (LPs).Liquidity providers are traders who lend funds to these pools in exchange for trading fees and potential liquidity incentives."}

They’re intended to becensorship-resistant,immutablerecord sources withinteroperablecapabilities. Immutable in the sense that these transactions can not be reversed and interoperable in the sense that blockchain accounts can seamlessly interact with other accounts and applications. Transactions on a blockchain are grouped into blocks and are verified by adistributednetwork of computers that earn money for participating in the verification process. Distributed means that these computers are not governed by any central entity but rather by a widespread collection of individual entities. This network collectively puts together a public ledger that can be indexed and searched with extreme detail. Anything that happens on a public blockchain is immediately and immutably a part of the public record."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Blockchain Foundations", "input": "Accounts & Wallets", "output": "Each account on a blockchain is accessed with a digital wallet. Accounts hold an individual or entity’s tokens which can be freely transferred between wallets and interact with applications that are compatible with the wallet. These applications can be financial or used for gaming, messaging, and virtually anything else. Unlike traditional markets, blockchains operate all day, so on-chain markets run 24/7, and anyone with a wallet can partake in them."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Blockchain Foundations", "input": "Reducing Counterparty Risk", "output": "Consensus methodsare the backbone of any blockchain. In the next chapter, we’ll go into more detail about how they work. Still, they are meant to give disparate network participants the ability to verifythe truthwithout having to trust anyone or rely on any centralized entity to act accurately or ethically. Not wanting to trust a counterparty may sound counterintuitive, butif there is no counterparty, then there is no counterparty risk.If there are no ethics, there is no misbehavior. It’s a technical philosophy embodied in the code behind decentralized systems, and it’s all possible because of consensus methods. Consensusmethodsarealgorithmsthat an incentivized computer network uses to participate in collective transaction verification. The process of how this works varies from method to method."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Blockchain Foundations", "input": "Digital Transparency", "output": "Specific blockchains (ZEC, MXR, SCRT) are oriented towards privacy, but most are transparent by default. Every detail of every transaction can be openly searched and indexed on a blockchain scanner, as shown below. You can see that there was a transfer from one wallet to another of 0.00203928 SOL on March 18, 03:21:07 AM +UTC, and the transaction fee was 0.000005 SOL (a fraction of $0.01). On other blockchains, transaction fees can go into the dozens and hundreds of dollars pretty quickly depending on network congestion. Using Solana, you can make 1,000,000 trades and only pay ~$10 in transaction fees."}

Countries that use theirproprietarycurrency other than the big 6 (USD– United States Dollar,CAD– Canadian Dollar,EUR– Euro,AUS– Australian Dollar,JPY– Japanese Yen, andGBP– British Pound) – are subject to grave risks imposed by the arbiters of the big 6. Rather than hold onto, for example – the Turkish Lira or South African Rand and have their spending power decline over time, many have fled to BTC or other cryptocurrencies that enablepseudonymous, secure transfers of valueand opportunities for capital appreciation. Bitcoin, for example, increased in value by 6,965,454,545.45% between 2010 and 2021. Its low was $0.00099, and the all-time high was $$68,958."}

They often aren’t. The stock market, for example, is constantly attempting to base prices and valuations on future expectations. To predict future outcomes, you want the least amount of uncertainty involved. Markets crave certainty. When outcomes are uncertain – such as when a supply chain crisis, a war, or a pandemic occurs- prices will reflect that. Speculative assets like revenueless tech stocks or purposeless altcoins will reflect uncertainty by having their price spike downwards because there is no more perceived value.Re-pricings will occur, even if it’s not immediate. It’s easy to forget that asset prices can go down another 99% after dropping by 99%."}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Blockchain Foundations", "input": "Mimetic Desire and Gold", "output": "Physical bars of Gold has outperformed most assets during periods of economic strife. As one of the oldest forms of human currency, Gold has become what is referred to as a safe haven asset. It’s important to understand that money flows from speculative investments to safe-haven assets isn’t happening automatically. It’s a result of trader psychology being influenced bymimetic desire, and it happens slowly, then all at once (similar to how risk works – stairway up, elevator down). Mimetic desireis best explained with an analogy. Imagine you are standing next to someone on a trampoline. That person sees something they want that requires them to jump to reach it. When they jump, you feel the movement of the trampoline underneath you. A natural reaction is to look at where this movement is coming from. When you see what the person next to you wants,Mimetictheoryargues that you’ll also start to want that thing. Learn more about ithere. Other than its use in jewelry,Goldis perceived to exist outside of the traditional financial system, althoughbanks are the largest owners of it, and derivatives are constantly used to manipulate its price –so that is a relatively naïve assumption. Below is one of the many headlines detailingbig bank baboonery. In this instance, JPM Chase had to pay a $920 million fine. They’ll survive. Even though Gold has performed well in the past during times of distress, this rise in value is not based on any fundamental, intrinsic characteristic. Gold is not easy to transport or store, especially at scale.Try moving $1 billion in Gold across an ocean.Due to big players in the industry, Gold is actually a very centralized commodity, and the price will only appreciate because of a fluctuatingextrinsicvalue. Someone will see that someone else has Gold, and they’ll want it. What if everyone thought silver was a better store of value, or tungsten, or rhodium, or zinc… or Bitcoin?"}
{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Blockchain Foundations", "input": "Bitcoin as Digital Gold", "output": "Narratives drive markets as much or more than fear and uncertainty do. Although Gold hasn’t been a practical currency in hundreds if not thousands of years in most places, it’s still being recommended by big banks and asset managers as a safe haven asset worthy of 1-5% of a traditional financial nest egg in the off-chance that calamity happens. This narrative that it stores its value in times of distress is just that – a narrative. It will work until it doesn’t. If rarity or scarcity is the argument, there are more scarce assets on this planet that could replace Gold if the narrative shifted. Bitcoin is one of them. As proposed in the white paper, Bitcoin was initially conceived as apeer-to-peer method of exchange. It has since become part of the larger store of value narrative that Gold can attribute its declining relevance to, except this time – it’s digital. Bitcoin has been referred to asDigital Goldby many investors and mainstream media pundits, partially because that’s the most digestible explanation they can come up with and partially because it’s true. It’s not the whole story behind what, how, and why Bitcoin came to be, but it’s agoodand strong story. Traditional investors can now fathom investing 1-5% of their portfolio into Bitcoin, and more progressive investors have a new lens to view markets with. The idea of existing outside the traditional financial system will be an important one to touch on again when we start coveringDeFi(Decentralized Finance) later in this course."}

If the transaction shows as completed on a Solana blockchain explorer, we suggest you get in touch with the CEX’s support. 2. I have sent other SPL tokens to a CEX and they aren’t showing up! There are CEXs that only partially support SPL tokens. If the exchange eventually lists that SPL token it may be made available on your account, otherwise you should contact the CEX so they inform you if it’s possible to retrieve those assets. Usually, this entails a finder’s fee. 3. Someone obtained my mnemonic and stole my tokens; can you get them back? If you’ve given away your mnemonic (recovery phrase), we can’t help you recover the assets, as stated previously as there is no method to stop funds or assets being transferred out of a compromised mnemonic.You must abandon that wallet and mnemonic and generate a new one.If you’ve noticed that there are other assets left, you must act quickly and send whatever is left to a new address.

If you aren’t an advanced user or a developer there’s no need to switch out of the mainnet option, however, here’s an explanation for all three of them. Solana’s Mainnet serves as the realm where all the transactions on the Solana network are processed. It’s here where the distributed ledger keeps track of everyone’s token balances. Devnet is where you can access all functions on the main net for testing and development purposes without actually interacting or risking real assets on the mainnet.Tokens on Devnet are not real assets and cannot be transferred over to mainnet in any way. Testnet is similar to Devnet, but focuses on network performance and stability, it is oriented to be used by validators.Tokens on Testnet are not real assets and cannot be transferred over to mainnet in any way. ⚠️ Anyone who offers to send you tokens from Solana’s Devnet or Testnet in exchange for an asset you’d send on Mainnet is a bad actor.⚠️ If this has happened to you Solflare’s customer support may advise you on what actions to take, however keep in mind that we are not able to retrieve any tokens sent.

{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: How to revoke approved token transactions (permissions) on the Solflare wallet", "input": "General Instructions", "output": "If you need to cancel an approved future interaction, we have you covered in this article. Note: This is a different process than disconnecting from a dApp, which we cover inthis article. Signing a smart contract with your wallet could approve a transaction on your behalf, this transaction can be either recurring or non-recurring. Thus permission to move assets around is granted so that this transaction happens automatically when a certain condition is met, this condition may vary from dApp to dApp, for example when you get liquidated by an exchange. When you sign one of these contracts, the address you interacted with will be posted on the portfolio screen of your wallet, if by any chance you don’t remember signing one of these types of transactions with your Solflare wallet, you will be able toREVOKEthe approval. There are various ways an approval notification can end up on your portfolio screen; not all are malicious. You might in fact have auctioned off a certain NFT or may have set a futures position that the Decentralized Exchange of your choice needs to liquidate, so constantly clicking on the revoke button will most likely cause you trouble with some dApps. We recommend you keep a log of what transactions you sign since most dApps don’t name or identify their operating address or the actions their app runs on the Solana network, which makes it harder for less experienced users to identify them. If you’re unsure about the origin of any approval, revoke the transaction or reach out to the support team so we can help you make that decision.You can also check out thisvideo guide tweet. (❗)This process will not reverse transactions or transfers that have already taken place."}
