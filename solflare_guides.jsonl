{"instruction": "Talk about this relating to the wallet Solflare: Can you help me recover my lost assets?", "input": "Here are some typical situations you may encounter as a user:", "output": "1.I have sent SOL to a centralized exchange (CEX) and it isn‚Äôt showing up! If the CEX you‚Äôve sent your tokens to does not natively support the Solana Network, they might take up to 24 hours to be settled into your account. If the transaction shows as completed on a Solana blockchain explorer, we suggest you get in touch with the CEX‚Äôs support. 2. I have sent other SPL tokens to a CEX and they aren‚Äôt showing up! There are CEXs that only partially support SPL tokens. If the exchange eventually lists that SPL token it may be made available on your account, otherwise you should contact the CEX so they inform you if it‚Äôs possible to retrieve those assets. Usually, this entails a finder‚Äôs fee. 3. Someone obtained my mnemonic and stole my tokens; can you get them back? If you‚Äôve given away your mnemonic (recovery phrase), we can‚Äôt help you recover the assets, as stated previously as there is no method to stop funds or assets being transferred out of a compromised mnemonic.You must abandon that wallet and mnemonic and generate a new one.If you‚Äôve noticed that there are other assets left, you must act quickly and send whatever is left to a new address. This, however, is a risky procedure, as the scammer/thief might still be on the lookout. 4. Someone stole my assets but there are still some left over, is it safe to move these tokens? If you think your tokens were manually stolen, there might be an opportunity to recover whatever you have left. We suggest contacting our support team, since we may be able to guide you on the best course of action, even if we can‚Äôt retrieve whatever was already stolen. If your situation has nothing to do with these cases (or even if it does, and you just want a more in-depth look), feel free to send us a message, we‚Äôre glad to help you out!

Using this, you can switch between Solana mainnet, devnet and testnet and will also be warned that devnet and testnet assets hold no real value. If you aren‚Äôt an advanced user or a developer there‚Äôs no need to switch out of the mainnet option, however, here‚Äôs an explanation for all three of them. Solana‚Äôs Mainnet serves as the realm where all the transactions on the Solana network are processed. It‚Äôs here where the distributed ledger keeps track of everyone‚Äôs token balances. Devnet is where you can access all functions on the main net for testing and development purposes without actually interacting or risking real assets on the mainnet.Tokens on Devnet are not real assets and cannot be transferred over to mainnet in any way. Testnet is similar to Devnet, but focuses on network performance and stability, it is oriented to be used by validators.Tokens on Testnet are not real assets and cannot be transferred over to mainnet in any way. ‚ö†Ô∏è Anyone who offers to send you tokens from Solana‚Äôs Devnet or Testnet in exchange for an asset you‚Äôd send on Mainnet is a bad actor.‚ö†Ô∏è If this has happened to you Solflare‚Äôs customer support may advise you on what actions to take, however keep in mind that we are not able to retrieve any tokens sent.

So‚Ä¶ how does it work?Essentially, the Burner Wallet is a ‚Äòthrow-away‚Äô account that you can use to mint NFTs or connect to apps that you may not necessarily fully trust. This way, in the event that you connect to a malicious website, then only the Burner Wallet account will be affected, and the other accounts in your wallet will be absolutely safe.For example, if there is an NFT mint that you do not fully trust, then you add a Burner Wallet and transfer only the needed amount of APT in order to mint. This way, if the funds are drained from a malicious site or app, then you only lose the actual mint amount, and the rest of your wallet is unaffected.Step 1: Click the profile picture at the top of your Solflare Wallet Step 2: At the bottom of your account list, you will see the option toCreate Burner Wallet, go ahead and select that and follow the prompts.

Note: This is a different process than disconnecting from a dApp, which we cover inthis article. Signing a smart contract with your wallet could approve a transaction on your behalf, this transaction can be either recurring or non-recurring. Thus permission to move assets around is granted so that this transaction happens automatically when a certain condition is met, this condition may vary from dApp to dApp, for example when you get liquidated by an exchange. When you sign one of these contracts, the address you interacted with will be posted on the portfolio screen of your wallet, if by any chance you don‚Äôt remember signing one of these types of transactions with your Solflare wallet, you will be able toREVOKEthe approval. There are various ways an approval notification can end up on your portfolio screen; not all are malicious. You might in fact have auctioned off a certain NFT or may have set a futures position that the Decentralized Exchange of your choice needs to liquidate, so constantly clicking on the revoke button will most likely cause you trouble with some dApps. We recommend you keep a log of what transactions you sign since most dApps don‚Äôt name or identify their operating address or the actions their app runs on the Solana network, which makes it harder for less experienced users to identify them. If you‚Äôre unsure about the origin of any approval, revoke the transaction or reach out to the support team so we can help you make that decision.You can also check out thisvideo guide tweet.
